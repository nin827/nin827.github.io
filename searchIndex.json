Built with productivity and performance in mind, their skills and expertise have proven to be indispensable — thriving by contributing to the economy and society at large.\nThe first batch of androids were created in early 2070s — artificial, mechanical, sapient, humanoid robots. Initially, they lived privately and comfortably, physically isolated from the external world — having all resources and support necessary to live a fulfilling life despite restrictions.\nThe experimental batch goes smoothly during the stage without any single incidents, to then be slowly exposed to the real world, until late 2080s. By then, despite some resistances, they found their place in some urban cities — being able to thrive by providing valuable services with their newfound skills and abilities.\nFew first cities that android lives in include <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Bangkok</a>, Tokyo, Shenzhen, Berlin, San Francisco — initially only living in closed-off buildings, then eventually to be free to explore after late 2080s.\nAfter things have properly settled, the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Android Individuality Agreement</a> was signed after androids have proved their place and worth to the society, enabling androids' international rights to live and exist as independent individuals.\nBreakdown\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/material/element/el-000010/\">Artificial intelligence</a>: Androids' artificial intelligence are capable of expressing emotions and comprehending nuances like humans — yet fundamentally distinct due to digital and robotic origins, making them logically-driven in nature.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Physical &amp; Appearance</a>: Android have many physical design and characteristics similar to a human, but with distinctively-robotic elements and features that clearly sets them apart from humans.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Mental &amp; Behavior</a>: Androids — despite being a robot — can fully comprehend human emotional, societal, and cultural nuances — and that all androids have their own personalities and individualities.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/material/element/el-000011/\">Sustenance &amp; Requirements</a>: Androids, like any working machine or organisms, require regular intake of fuel and water — along with diagnostics and maintenance to ensure proper functioning.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Combat Model</a>: Android combat model, known as &quot;combat android&quot; — are rare subset of androids with upgraded specifications or additional modifications different from average androids — of which are associated in military, security, and criminal settings.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/material/element/el-000019/\">Production &amp; Deployment</a>: Android's mind are installed into their physical body once the 3-year incubation period is over — are then officially deployed to the society with full autonomy and independence, but has financial obligations to pay back to their manufacturer.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Life Trajectory </a>: Androids life trajectory usually starts with a period of training, followed by signing an individual contract for financial support and career boost — to then thrive or survive enough to pay off any obligations they got.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">History &amp; Origins</a>: Androids are first created in early 2070— living privately in a controlled environment, isolated from the external world. It took some effort for them to slowly for the first generation to eventually be recognized by the society by late 2080s.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/material/element/el-000013/\">Human—Android Coexistence </a>: Both humans and androids have learned to coexist with each other for the greater benefit as a whole society — androids offers expertise and productivity, while humans offers resources and opportunities.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Population &amp; Distribution</a>: Android makes up a tiny subset of the world population, at 0.1% of 8 billion population globally — of which are further cross-divided into 24:1 ratio for urban—rural areas and 49:1 ratio for supporting—opposing areas.",

He stopped in front of a simple stone — holding a single white flower in his hands.\n\nFor a moment, he just stood there in silence — then kneeled on the cold, wet grass.\nHe then leaned inwards and carefully placed a white flower on the stone.\nThe grave was written with the name he knew too well, and dates he felt too close together.\nIt was a weird feeling for Vin. Technically, it was him — yet, not him. He is alive standing above the grave — yet, dead resting below the ground. Here he was, android self paying respects to human self.\nHe did not feel any melancholy nor sorrow — just sentiments of his previous life. It was an unusual thought for Vin to mentally process.\nHe remained there for few minutes. It felt like several minutes to him.\nThe night stretched on, endless and indifferent.\nThen he turned and walked away, leaving the dead to their silence.",

Everyone, including Vin himself were on the field having fun with a football match.\nOne of his officers jogged over, catching his breath. &quot;Damn, remember how Vin used to fake that left turn? Swear he pulled it on me every time.&quot;\n&quot;Yeah. Annoying as hell.&quot; Vin responded, with a slight bit of delay.\nThe man laughed, nudging him. &quot;Mind showing us here how it’s done?&quot;\nJust across the street, he noticed someone too familiar not too far away — Ella, walking along the sidewalk beyond the fence, arms loaded with restaurant supply bags. She wasn’t looking their way.\n&quot;Alright, enough nostalgia,&quot; Vin said, louder than necessary. &quot;Let's switch it up to something else.&quot;\nGroans followed, but the team complied, shifting focus. Vin didn’t turn to watch Ella’s reaction.\nHe didn’t need to — Vin shifted his focus back to the game.\nElla’s Perspective\nThe weight of the grocery bags made Ella’s arms ache as she passed the football field. She wouldn’t have glanced over at all if not for the familiar voices — ones she hadn’t heard in months.\n&quot;— Vin used to fake that left turn —&quot;\nHer head snapped up.\nThere they were — Vin’s old security unit, the same group that used to crowd her bar after shifts. They were running drills, laughing between plays. One of them had just said his name.\nHer chest tightened.\nOf course they’d talk about him. They’d worked together for years. It made sense they’d reminisce while training.\nShe slowed and looked at them for few seconds, watching them continue playing football and just having some fun.\nSomething prickled at the back of her mind, but she shoved it down.\nShe does miss him — but there is no point to yearn for someone that is gone.\nJust old friends remembering old tricks. Nothing more.\nAdjusting her grip on the bags, she walked on with increased pace.\n\n[!note]\nDraft test-generated with DeepSeek, but rewritten most of it so it doesn't count as one?",

She sat there peacefully — just reminiscing in her memories with her lover, who she used to sit together with under this very same spot.\nFamiliar, yet different. Peaceful, but unresolved. Sorrow, not distraught. Sentimental, and nostalgic.\nIt has been a decent while since his passing. She's had enough time to process her emotions — but appreciates having more time to sort through her thoughts.\nPerhaps, she should move on with her life as usual.

		"content": "[!empty]\nGenAIs &amp; LLMs Purpose and Nuances NO0002\nNotes regarding GenAIs &amp; LLMs usage, scenario, ethics, and nuances — including nin827's personal observation and remarks.\ngenai | ai | llm | ethics | moral | nuances | caution | careful optimism\n\nNotes regarding GenAIs &amp; LLMs usage, scenario, ethics, and nuances — including nin827's personal observation and remarks.\nThis page will specifically mention GenAIs, not just &quot;AI&quot; — as it is more accurate to describe a large language model (LLMs) that are capable of generating (therefore GenAIs abbreviation) various content according to the issued instruction.\n\nThe term &quot;AI&quot; is a buzzword that may not be exactly specific — it generally to smart programming that can respond accordingly to the input and circumstances.[1]\nTL:DR Summary: Use GenAIs as a tool or crutch, not replacement for yourself. GenAIs are not always factual nor accurate, you must check and correct mistakes it made to make sure. You (when using GenAIs) are not the author — you are the commissioner to the author (which are GenAIs),\n\nGenAIs—although highly controversial, it can be rather useful in aiding with peoples' productivity and performance—but one must be aware on how much impact it can have on you and others.\n\nEthical-wise, there are concerns of intellectual rights being scraped off the internet, or even directly uploaded into the database without their consent — with absolute zero regards to the rights holder.\nCognition-wise, there are concerns of people over-relying GenAIs for critical thinking, problem solving, fact checking, or even forming opinions — with little to zero effort on the users' part.\nEnvironment-wise, there are concerns of rising GenAIs consuming too much energy and impacting the environment — considering that LLMs takes in lot of power to do all queries and computations.[2]\nBehavior-wise, there are people who rely too much on GenAIs as emotional support or having a relationship with—ignoring the fact that they are having a parasocial relationship with a large language model, not a person.\nPrivacy-wise, most LLMs that are hosted on internet can or may collect your input and responses for any purposes—only put what you are ready to share, assume people can read what you put.\n\nAs GenAIs is designed a tool — it can be beneficial if used correctly and appropriately, it can also be harmful if used excessively or mindlessly — treat it as your tool or assistant, not as authority or gospel of truth.\n\nBe aware that GenAIs as of 2020s is basically a supercharged auto-correct — it does not actually reason with what you said to them, just what is the most logical or probable to respond to you with.\nDo not take everything GenAIs said word-by-word. It may sound logical and convincing, but it does not necessarily mean true nor accurate. Do further fact checks as necessary.\nUse GenAIs to assist with your productivity, not to replace your own work entirely. Considering that GenAIs could not handle complex instructions nor consider relevant context correctly.\nTake everything generated by GenAIs with a grain of salt. Critically evaluate it with your knowledge or intuition, and check if is factually accurate or properly executed.\nLet GenAIs do the heavy lifting, while you doing the thinking and checking — if you do not do final checks, mistakes can easily slip through and work quality will suffer as a result.\n\nCommon correct and accepted uses includes but are not limited to … as basic reference/research — as temporary/placeholder assets — as non-valuable filler contents. Note that these applies to all contents such as graphics, coding, music, writing, etc.\n\nDo not treat AI as a factual authority, verify and check the generated content to be sure. This especially applies in programming under commercial settings — especially if it involves complex set of codes.\nEspecially for arts/creative settings — do not claim the AI-generated content as your own. It is frowned upon by many, especially among those who value the human/emotional/sentimental aspect.\nAI-assisted workflow or content is usually acceptable — even in creative settings to a small extent — but one must disclose the fact where possible, and try to make sure you involve yourself with at significant part of the work.\nNever, ever, to simply use AI-generated content with zero checks, as in one-done-copy-paste-process — AI does not always understand your request accurately, and maybe even present hallucinations into the final product.\n\nGenAIs usage do get muddy when it involves copyrighted/trademarked content in the database — training data, response output, or malicious use to infringe on IP rights has to be considered too.\n\nThere's an infamous ongoing situation of ChatGPT and Studio Ghibli art style in early 2025. While it can be argued that the art style itself cannot be copyrighted; the fact of the LLMs using every frame/artwork of their IPs in as training data does raise legitimate concerns, and art style and their likeliness can still be trademarked.\nIs it fine to replicate protected IPs through deliberate prompts but without IP content as training data? To what extent what be replicated while still being legally right and socially accepted?\n\nThe issue is that this word is vague — it can refer to generic smart programming, to sapient/sentient general artificial intelligence (unrealistic as of 2020s), to GenAIs &amp; LLMs (relevant as of 2020s). ↩︎\n\nHowever, this area is still in heavy development — there is a global AI tech race to develop smarter and more efficient LLMs. Example being DeepSeek with their multiple task-specific models, allowing efficient computations and recalls — compared to ChatGPT with singular general-purpose model that is proficient at everything. ↩︎",

Think.\nReal-life parallels in fiction don’t mean 1:1 allegories.\nAsk: Is this story inviting me to question something, or just to accept it?\nDon’t blame fiction for real-world problems — but don’t ignore its cultural impact either.\nIt’s fine to emotionally invest in fiction, but remember: no fictional character needs your 'protection'—they’re not real.\nFictional characters are narrative tools, not sentient beings—debating their 'morality' is like judging a chess piece’s motives.\nHeadcanons are fun, but treating them as canon leads to unnecessary conflict with creators and other fans.\n\n[!info] Tips: Simple Things to Keep in Mind\n\nWhen you don't know something, try search it up online or POLITELY ask for explanations.\nWhen you don't know what that word is, search &quot;define WORD&quot; or read the surrounding context.\nIt is best to avoid having strong opinions until you are at least 90% sure about it, keep it in for a while first.\nKnow that your opinion or knowledge may not be 100% perfect, be open to changes, but also hold your grounds.\nPreferences has no rights or wrongs, but opinions can have rights or wrongs depending on the knowledge built upon.\nBy issuing death threats, you are positioning them as a sympathetic victim and undermines your cause (even if reasonable/valid).

[1]\nWriting is expected to be formatted and structured as A6 light novel, with occasional quick-sketch thumbnail illustrations to complement the writing, essentially a hybrid of (Japanese style if you prefer) novel and comic.\nThese literary and illustrative works will be published on personal Tumblr blog (nin827.tumblr.com) and also saved as Microsoft Word file format for future use cases.\nChapters should include 6 sections in total, each including a standard thumbnail, content spanning 2 pages at all times, and paragraphs spanning 3–6 lines on average (up to 12 maximums on rare cases).\nEvery setting (event and character) must at least have a section-length snippet containing 3 scenarios (focus, main, and extra) under standard circumstances. In addition to main snippet content, each snippet should also have brief-single-sentence as a descriptor.\nAll snippets will have 1-sentence version as a brief descriptor. The scenario will have normal-length snippet to flesh out the setting, however, the main scenario illustration will be used to represent that said setting.\nNarrative notes: ...\n\nThe main timeline is expected to be based on modern and contemporary Bangkok (in Thailand) focusing on observation and events of the real life. However, there are added concepts being sentient–AI androids, technological advancement, and various unusual phenomenon.\nAs the story and setting will be partially based on modern real-life but with additional fictional science stuff added and is meant to mimic real life, the theme can be categorized to be contemporary and speculative sci-fi as for the theme.\nThe story will employ omniscient third-person perspective for the most part, though there may be some parts that uses first-person perspective, but this will have to be explicitly stated one way or another to avoid confusion.\nShould there ever be a case of having different timelines, the main one will be the Modern Timeline; subjected to future changes, if there will be any.\n\nNovel print format size will be A6 at 4.13 by 5.83 inches, with margin of 0.5 by 0.5 inches, with vertical orientation, with illustration image size of at 1.2 by 1.2 inches per 512 by 512 pixels (as with image canvas size), with image resolution of 250 pixels per inch; other specifications are non-illustration images size of 0.3 inches increments (ideally in square aspect ratio). ↩︎",

Courtesy is still appreciated regardless of substantial feedback. ↩︎\n\nCreate a standardized pre-publish checklist covering: (1) canon consistency, (2) factual accuracy (if applicable), (3) logical flow, (4) tone alignment, (5) sensitivity review (where appropriate), (5) spelling/grammar, and (6) fulfillment of any promises made about the content. Not all must be made with each publish, please consider the project scope and circumstances to adjust the checklist accordingly. ↩︎\n\nStrongly consider seek engagement from sensitive readers for sensitive topics, or subject matter expert for complex topics before publication. Document their feedbacks, what was their reaction/perception, and how to address it. Sanitizing content too much to the point of being sterile can end up boring — and may even be counterproductive to sensitive group of audience you meant to target to. ↩︎\n\nIf the work inherently holds a strong bias, include a brief, transparent statement acknowledging its stance and the effort made to understand opposing views, without undermining the work's own position. Use preface, footnotes, or remarks without indirectly incorporating into the main content. ↩︎\n\nReference documents include but are not limited to wiki, database, style guide, directories, profile, etc. ↩︎\n\nThis does not apply to small one-done-deal projects — only one to few reference files will suffice, or even none are needed. Anything else may require some documentation to play safe, start with documents and spreadsheets for small projects, or PKMS like Notion/Obsidian for medium/large projects. ↩︎\n\nIf an unintended contradiction with established canon is discovered during creation: 1) Pause development on the conflicting element. 2) Re-examine both the new idea and the old canon. 3) Choose the option that best serves the core narrative integrity and audience experience, documenting the decision. Prioritize fixing the cause of the contradiction over retconning the symptom. ↩︎",
