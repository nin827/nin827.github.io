		"content": "[!empty]\nGenAIs &amp; LLMs Purpose and Nuances NO0002\nNotes regarding GenAIs &amp; LLMs usage, scenario, ethics, and nuances — including nin827's personal observation and remarks.\ngenai | ai | llm | ethics | moral | nuances | caution | careful optimism\n\nNotes regarding GenAIs &amp; LLMs usage, scenario, ethics, and nuances — including nin827's personal observation and remarks.\nThis page will specifically mention GenAIs, not just &quot;AI&quot; — as it is more accurate to describe a large language model (LLMs) that are capable of generating (therefore GenAIs abbreviation) various content according to the issued instruction.\n\nThe term &quot;AI&quot; is a buzzword that may not be exactly specific — it generally to smart programming that can respond accordingly to the input and circumstances.[1]\nTL:DR Summary: Use GenAIs as a tool or crutch, not replacement for yourself. GenAIs are not always factual nor accurate, you must check and correct mistakes it made to make sure. You (when using GenAIs) are not the author — you are the commissioner to the author (which are GenAIs),\n\nGenAIs—although highly controversial, it can be rather useful in aiding with peoples' productivity and performance—but one must be aware on how much impact it can have on you and others.\n\nEthical-wise, there are concerns of intellectual rights being scraped off the internet, or even directly uploaded into the database without their consent — with absolute zero regards to the rights holder.\nCognition-wise, there are concerns of people over-relying GenAIs for critical thinking, problem solving, fact checking, or even forming opinions — with little to zero effort on the users' part.\nEnvironment-wise, there are concerns of rising GenAIs consuming too much energy and impacting the environment — considering that LLMs takes in lot of power to do all queries and computations.[2]\nBehavior-wise, there are people who rely too much on GenAIs as emotional support or having a relationship with—ignoring the fact that they are having a parasocial relationship with a large language model, not a person.\nPrivacy-wise, most LLMs that are hosted on internet can or may collect your input and responses for any purposes—only put what you are ready to share, assume people can read what you put.\n\nAs GenAIs is designed a tool — it can be beneficial if used correctly and appropriately, it can also be harmful if used excessively or mindlessly — treat it as your tool or assistant, not as authority or gospel of truth.\n\nBe aware that GenAIs as of 2020s is basically a supercharged auto-correct — it does not actually reason with what you said to them, just what is the most logical or probable to respond to you with.\nDo not take everything GenAIs said word-by-word. It may sound logical and convincing, but it does not necessarily mean true nor accurate. Do further fact checks as necessary.\nUse GenAIs to assist with your productivity, not to replace your own work entirely. Considering that GenAIs could not handle complex instructions nor consider relevant context correctly.\nTake everything generated by GenAIs with a grain of salt. Critically evaluate it with your knowledge or intuition, and check if is factually accurate or properly executed.\nLet GenAIs do the heavy lifting, while you doing the thinking and checking — if you do not do final checks, mistakes can easily slip through and work quality will suffer as a result.\n\nCommon correct and accepted uses includes but are not limited to … as basic reference/research — as temporary/placeholder assets — as non-valuable filler contents. Note that these applies to all contents such as graphics, coding, music, writing, etc.\n\nDo not treat AI as a factual authority, verify and check the generated content to be sure. This especially applies in programming under commercial settings — especially if it involves complex set of codes.\nEspecially for arts/creative settings — do not claim the AI-generated content as your own. It is frowned upon by many, especially among those who value the human/emotional/sentimental aspect.\nAI-assisted workflow or content is usually acceptable — even in creative settings to a small extent — but one must disclose the fact where possible, and try to make sure you involve yourself with at significant part of the work.\nNever, ever, to simply use AI-generated content with zero checks, as in one-done-copy-paste-process — AI does not always understand your request accurately, and maybe even present hallucinations into the final product.\n\nGenAIs usage do get muddy when it involves copyrighted/trademarked content in the database — training data, response output, or malicious use to infringe on IP rights has to be considered too.\n\nThere's an infamous ongoing situation of ChatGPT and Studio Ghibli art style in early 2025. While it can be argued that the art style itself cannot be copyrighted; the fact of the LLMs using every frame/artwork of their IPs in as training data does raise legitimate concerns, and art style and their likeliness can still be trademarked.\nIs it fine to replicate protected IPs through deliberate prompts but without IP content as training data? To what extent what be replicated while still being legally right and socially accepted?\n\nThe issue is that this word is vague — it can refer to generic smart programming, to sapient/sentient general artificial intelligence (unrealistic as of 2020s), to GenAIs &amp; LLMs (relevant as of 2020s). ↩︎\n\nHowever, this area is still in heavy development — there is a global AI tech race to develop smarter and more efficient LLMs. Example being DeepSeek with their multiple task-specific models, allowing efficient computations and recalls — compared to ChatGPT with singular general-purpose model that is proficient at everything. ↩︎",
