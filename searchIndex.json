Built with productivity and performance in mind, their skills and expertise have proven to be indispensable — thriving by contributing to the economy and society at large.\nThe first batch of androids were created in early 2070s — artificial, mechanical, sapient, humanoid robots. Initially, they lived privately and comfortably, physically isolated from the external world — having all resources and support necessary to live a fulfilling life despite restrictions.\nThe experimental batch goes smoothly during the stage without any single incidents, to then be slowly exposed to the real world, until late 2080s. By then, despite some resistances, they found their place in some urban cities — being able to thrive by providing valuable services with their newfound skills and abilities.\nFew first cities that android lives in include <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/material/article/ar-002/\">Bangkok</a>, Tokyo, Shenzhen, Berlin, San Francisco — initially only living in closed-off buildings, then eventually to be free to explore after late 2080s.\nAfter things have properly settled, the <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Android Individuality Agreement</a> was signed after androids have proved their place and worth to the society, enabling androids' international rights to live and exist as independent individuals.\nBreakdown\n\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/material/element/el-000010/\">Artificial intelligence</a>: Androids' artificial intelligence are capable of expressing emotions and comprehending nuances like humans — yet fundamentally distinct due to digital and robotic origins, making them logically-driven in nature.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Physical &amp; Appearance</a>: Android have many physical design and characteristics similar to a human, but with distinctively-robotic elements and features that clearly sets them apart from humans.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Mental &amp; Behavior</a>: Androids — despite being a robot — can fully comprehend human emotional, societal, and cultural nuances — and that all androids have their own personalities and individualities.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/material/element/el-000011/\">Sustenance &amp; Requirements</a>: Androids, like any working machine or organisms, require regular intake of fuel and water — along with diagnostics and maintenance to ensure proper functioning.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Combat Model</a>: Android combat model, known as &quot;combat android&quot; — are rare subset of androids with upgraded specifications or additional modifications different from average androids — of which are associated in military, security, and criminal settings.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/material/element/el-000019/\">Production &amp; Deployment</a>: Android's mind are installed into their physical body once the 3-year incubation period is over — are then officially deployed to the society with full autonomy and independence, but has financial obligations to pay back to their manufacturer.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Life Trajectory </a>: Androids life trajectory usually starts with a period of training, followed by signing an individual contract for financial support and career boost — to then thrive or survive enough to pay off any obligations they got.\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">History &amp; Origins</a>: Androids are first created in early 2070— living privately in a controlled environment, isolated from the external world.

It felt easier, somehow, to stay in limbo.\nThat evening, the team gathered at a restaurant &amp; bar, clinking bottles under the hum of establishment patrons and nearby traffics.

He clearly remembered it smelled good, but the smell itself provokes no reaction. No mouth-watering, no hunger, no stomach grows, no physiological reactions, just the association with the senses from his memory.\n&quot;You good?&quot; a human colleague slurred, slinging an arm around him.\n&quot;Yeah,&quot; Vin said, staring at the bottle. &quot;Too good.&quot;\nHis android workmate smirked. &quot;Told you. No drunk, no hangover. Just… hydration and a bit of energy from that alcohol.&quot;\nThe group erupted into laughter, already tipsy, already moving on. Vin forced a grin and ordered another round.\nThe atmosphere within the team was casual and lively, drinking beverages and just talking among each other. Everyone, including Vin, enjoyed the familiar interactions and rituals between the members.\nLater, back at the office, he sat alone, rolling the empty can between his fingers. No buzz. No blur. Just clarity, sharp, and unrelenting.\nHe missed the numbness, but the flavor and aftertaste of the beer hit him home.\nOutside, the city pulsed on, indifferent. Vin vented a slow, unnecessary breath and rested on his chair. Things felt somewhat different, somewhat identical. Nothing too drastic has changed for him, despite him literally being in a new mechanical self.\nSome adjustments to be done, it seemed, had nothing to do with the body.\n\nContinue to: <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Vin's Initial Adjustment 3</a>",

GenAIs are not always factual nor accurate, you must check and correct mistakes it made to make sure. You (when using GenAIs) are not the author — you are the commissioner to the author (which are GenAIs),\nDo additional reading on GenAI on Wikipedia if possible.\n\nGenAIs—although highly controversial, it can be rather useful in aiding with peoples' productivity and performance—but one must be aware on how much impact it can have on you and others.\n\nEthical-wise, there are concerns of intellectual rights being scraped off the internet, or even directly uploaded into the database without their consent — with absolute zero regards to the rights holder.\nCognition-wise, there are concerns of people over-relying GenAIs for critical thinking, problem solving, fact checking, or even forming opinions — with little to zero effort on the users' part.\nEnvironment-wise, there are concerns of rising GenAIs consuming too much energy and impacting the environment — considering that LLMs takes in lot of power to do all queries and computations.[2]\nBehavior-wise, there are people who rely too much on GenAIs as emotional support or having a relationship with—ignoring the fact that they are having a parasocial relationship with a large language model, not a person.\nPrivacy-wise, most LLMs that are hosted on internet can or may collect your input and responses for any purposes—only put what you are ready to share, assume people can read what you put.\n\nAs GenAIs is designed a tool — it can be beneficial if used correctly and appropriately, it can also be harmful if used excessively or mindlessly — treat it as your tool or assistant, not as authority or gospel of truth.\n\nBe aware that GenAIs as of 2020s is basically a supercharged auto-correct — it does not actually reason with what you said to them, just what is the most logical or probable to respond to you with.\nDo not take everything GenAIs said word-by-word. It may sound logical and convincing, but it does not necessarily mean true nor accurate. Do further fact checks as necessary.\nUse GenAIs to assist with your productivity, not to replace your own work entirely. Considering that GenAIs could not handle complex instructions nor consider relevant context correctly.\nTake everything generated by GenAIs with a grain of salt. Critically evaluate it with your knowledge or intuition, and check if is factually accurate or properly executed.\nLet GenAIs do the heavy lifting, while you doing the thinking and checking — if you do not do final checks, mistakes can easily slip through and work quality will suffer as a result.\n\nCommon correct and accepted uses includes but are not limited to … as basic reference/research — as temporary/placeholder assets — as non-valuable filler contents. Note that these applies to all contents such as graphics, coding, music, writing, etc.\n\nDo not treat AI as a factual authority, verify and check the generated content to be sure. This especially applies in programming under commercial settings — especially if it involves complex set of codes.\nEspecially for arts/creative settings — do not claim the AI-generated content as your own. It is frowned upon by many, especially among those who value the human/emotional/sentimental aspect.\nAI-assisted workflow or content is usually acceptable — even in creative settings to a small extent — but one must disclose the fact where possible, and try to make sure you involve yourself with at significant part of the work.\nNever, ever, to simply use AI-generated content with zero checks, as in one-done-copy-paste-process — AI does not always understand your request accurately, and maybe even present hallucinations into the final product.\n\nGenAIs usage do get muddy when it involves copyrighted/trademarked content in the database — training data, response output, or malicious use to infringe on IP rights has to be considered too.\n\nThere's an infamous ongoing situation of ChatGPT and Studio Ghibli art style in early 2025. While it can be argued that the art style itself cannot be copyrighted; the fact of the LLMs using every frame/artwork of their IPs in as training data does raise legitimate concerns, and art style and their likeliness can still be trademarked.\nIs it fine to replicate protected IPs through deliberate prompts but without IP content as training data? To what extent what be replicated while still being legally right and socially accepted?\n\nThe issue is that this word is vague — it can refer to generic smart programming, to sapient/sentient general artificial intelligence (unrealistic as of 2020s), to GenAIs &amp; LLMs (relevant as of 2020s). ↩︎\n\nHowever, this area is still in heavy development — there is a global AI tech race to develop smarter and more efficient LLMs. Example being DeepSeek with their multiple task-specific models, allowing efficient computations and recalls — compared to ChatGPT with singular general-purpose model that is proficient at everything. ↩︎",

Courtesy is still appreciated regardless of substantial feedback. ↩︎\n\nCreate a standardized pre-publish checklist covering: (1) canon consistency, (2) factual accuracy (if applicable), (3) logical flow, (4) tone alignment, (5) sensitivity review (where appropriate), (5) spelling/grammar, and (6) fulfillment of any promises made about the content. Not all must be made with each publish, please consider the project scope and circumstances to adjust the checklist accordingly. ↩︎\n\nStrongly consider seek engagement from sensitive readers for sensitive topics, or subject matter expert for complex topics before publication. Document their feedbacks, what was their reaction/perception, and how to address it. Sanitizing content too much to the point of being sterile can end up boring — and may even be counterproductive to sensitive group of audience you meant to target to. ↩︎\n\nIf the work inherently holds a strong bias, include a brief, transparent statement acknowledging its stance and the effort made to understand opposing views, without undermining the work's own position. Use preface, footnotes, or remarks without indirectly incorporating into the main content. ↩︎\n\nReference documents include but are not limited to wiki, database, style guide, directories, profile, etc. ↩︎\n\nThis does not apply to small one-done-deal projects — only one to few reference files will suffice, or even none are needed. Anything else may require some documentation to play safe, start with documents and spreadsheets for small projects, or PKMS like Notion/Obsidian for medium/large projects. ↩︎\n\nIf an unintended contradiction with established canon is discovered during creation: 1) Pause development on the conflicting element. 2) Re-examine both the new idea and the old canon. 3) Choose the option that best serves the core narrative integrity and audience experience, documenting the decision. Prioritize fixing the cause of the contradiction over retconning the symptom. ↩︎",

The survey is conducted on July 2025.\nThis survey is primarily conducted on Laos Artist Group on Facebook, alongside with various smaller online community and groups.\n\nThe survey is conducted from 10/07/2025 until 20/07/2025 18:00 (UTC+7).\n\nThe main identity theme of <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/special/sp-ns-22/\">Project NS22</a> is mecha &amp; technology (as well as soft sci-fi, near future, and bits of sci-fi), particularly &quot;robots as human equal&quot; concept — yet it is rated moderately on average, yet very polarized between those who prefer and not prefer towards it.\n\nThere may be plenty &quot;robots as human equal&quot; concepts (or similar ones) out there, but the project aims to use one that has clear robotic appearance and is sapient &amp; sentient — while avoiding tropes portraying them as pseudo-superhumans.\nMost other &quot;robots as human equal&quot; often involve perfect human-like appearance (minus few features) appearance to blend with people, this project aims to present them as outwardly with no perfect human-like appearance — also avoiding uncanny valley effect altogether.\n\nKey takeaway is the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/special/sp-ns-22/\">Project NS22</a> is going to target and satisfy a specific niche, considering that the key-defining &quot;robots as human equal&quot; is not rated so high in general, but rated quite moderate among those who are inclined towards mecha &amp; technology.\n\nOther associated concepts, themes, and genre are rated fairly well, but still falls off compared to other aspects.\nCareful planning and smooth execution will be crucial for the project to be successful, considering there virtually no other media that has similar ideas; there may be similar ideas, but it is not specific enough.\n\nThe survey results and covered aspects may not be fully comprehensive nor is highly reliable — mostly due to limited responses collected from small online community, and reduced amount of questions to facilitate with faster response time.\n\nDemographics\nAge\n\nAge // ອາຍຸ\n\nNot surprising, since the Facebook and Discord group is targeted towards the young — who are more inclined to creative media and internet culture.\n\nGender\n\nGender // ເພດ\n\nBit surprising, honestly. Creative media is supposed to be for all due to no restrictions — yet female are more dominant than male in this regard.\n\nMedium\n\nWhich medium do you enjoy the most? // ເຈົ້າມັກປະເພດສື່ໃດຫຼາຍທີ່ສຸດ? ...\n\nNovel\n\n... Novel // ນິຍາຍ\n\nAverage rated: 3.44/5.00; the higher, the more they prefer novels.\n\nComic\n\n... Comic // ຄອມມິກ\n\nAverage rated: 3.96/5.00; the higher, the more they prefer comics.\n\nAnimation + Movie\n\n... Animation + Movie // ອານິເມຊັ້ນ + ໜັງ\n\nAverage rated: 4.30/5.00; the higher, the more they prefer animation and/or movies.\n\nPop Culture\n\nAre you into pop culture? // ເຈົ້າເຂົ້າໃນດ້ານ pop culture ບໍ່?\n\nAverage rated: 4.02/5.00; the higher, the more the enjoy pop (and internet) culture.\n\nStory Duration\n\nDo you like long or short stories? // ເຈົ້າມັກເລື່ອງສັ້ນຫຼືຍາວ?\n\nAverage rated: 3.65/5.00; the higher, the more they enjoy longer stories.\n\nAbout half prefers medium length, and the other half prefers longer length.\nThis seems to fit fair with the project scope to write long mainline novels, with occasional sideline novels.\n\nRead-more-online Interest\n\nIf something interests you, would you go read more online? // ຫາກວ່າເຈົ້າສົນໃຈສີ່ງໃດໜື່ງ, ເຈົ້າຈະໄປຄົ້ນອ່ານອອນໄລນ໌ເພີ້ມບໍ່?\n\nAverage rated: 4.61/5.00;

= 1.\n\nConsidering that Eastern style is one of dominant themes within East Asia creative media and is widespread within SEA, it's no surprise that it is one of the leading theme.\nFantasy theme is not included in the survey due to limited question space, but it is probable it will be in top 5 due to strong correlation with popular themes such as magic, medieval, isekai/otherworld, etc.\nFuture-related themes such as sci-fi, futuristic, and mecha &amp; technology itself are generally rated lower to classic-related themes (fantasy, magic, etc).\nMecha &amp; technology seems to be the most polarized in terms of preference, having the highest interested and not interested combined, and highest mid-point between the two.\n\nCorrelation\n\nCorrelation 101\n\nCorrelation = how much X and Y happens together\nCorrelation ≠ causation\n\nX goes with Y does not mean X causes Y\n\n50% ↔ 90% = X preferred, Y likely preferred\n10% ↔ 50% = X preferred, Y usually preferred\n-10% ↔ 10% = X preferred, Y preference or not preferred is about 50/50\n-50% ↔ -10% = X preferred, Y usually not preferred\n-90% ↔ -50% = X preferred, Y likely not preferred\n-100% ↔ -90% &amp; 90% ↔ 100% = Pretty much always measurement error or bad design\n\nMeasurement error (measurement unit): height in meters ↔ height in centimeters\nMeasurement error (same data): Prefers red ↔ Prefers red\nBad design (too obvious): Incidents of flamethrowing homes ↔ Incidents of house fires\nBad design (addition of products): Total calories consumed ↔ Total carbohydrate consumed\nBad design (subtraction of total): Fuel left % ↔ Fuel spent %\nBad design (opposite data): Likes yellow ↔ Dislikes yellow\n\nTo interpret, use this as a question: if X interests them, will Y interest them too?\n\nIt can also go the opposite: if X does not interests them, will Y not interest them too?\n\nNotable Observations\n\nConsidering that the main identity theme of the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/special/sp-ns-22/\">Project NS22</a> are mecha and technology (plus near future, business, and soft sci-fi):\n\nHas strong correlation with action at 51%; mecha (and technology) are often associated with action due to robot fights — although it's a surefire signal, I also would like to explore social aspect with AGI as well.\nHas strong correlation with sci-fi at 48%; my planned settings will incorporate technological and scientific developments, so a sure yes.\nHas strong correlation with futuristic at 48%; my planned settings will be near-future so it's a definite combo.\nHas strong correlation with anthropomorphic at 40%; humanoid robots definitely fit into this equation.\nHas strong correlation with adventure at 45%; but I do not plan to incorporate much of this.\nHas significant anti-correlation with eastern theme at -26%; fair point since it usually involves ancient and traditional themes/aesthetics as their settings, not modern not futuristic.\n\nUnusual observations noticed thus far:\n\nMedieval ↔ Magic — They are supposed to go hand-in-hand as they are often used in European-style fantasy, but somehow doesn't combo here?\nBusiness ↔ Drama — Surprising it isn't higher due to competition and strategy as core theme — usually it involves emotional conflicts, meticulous strategies, or ruthless backstabbing.\nSports ↔ Action — Sports is literally about action and competition, yet there's only weak link between the two???\nMedieval ↔ Western — Medieval is literally set in old ages of European, of which belongs to the Western, and yet no correlation between both?\nNot all will be written here, see the correlation chart for yourself and make your own interpretations.\n\nProject Concepts\n\nConsidering the main identity theme of the project is mecha and technology, it will be selected to compare against other various preferences as benchmark.\n\nFrom now on, preference_mechtech will be abbreviated as M&amp;T\nIgnore the preference_mechtech row, it is there only as reference and provides no meaningful result here.\nOther/LGBT gender result is exempted due to low count, results may not be meaningful or reliable with insufficient data.\nNote to take this reading with a grain of salt (skepticism) due to low data count, as results are split by gender and preference in M&amp;T — results here are not as reliable nor confident as correlation reading above.\n\nCategory: MEDIUM and others\n\nThere is a correlation in preferences toward shorter story length (still sits at medium) among those who prefers M&amp;T, and the average of female is higher than those of male — except for male who prefers M&amp;T, there is a slight rebound/increase in preferred story length.\nThere is a correlation in lower preference score in novels to higher interest to M&amp;T, female has higher average and weaker correlation, whereas male has lower average and strong correlation.\n\nMaybe results could be more determinate if there is a separation between &quot;pure-text&quot; novels and &quot;contains some illustration&quot; novels.\n\nAcross all medium, female has higher average preference score than male for some reason.\nResults and reading of all else in these category are not so noteworthy nor is significant enough.\n\nCategory: PREFERENCES\n\nAs said before, ignore the preference_mechtech row.\nRemember that M&amp;T in <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/resource/note/no-0012/#theme-and-amp-genre-preferences\">Theme &amp; Genre Preferences</a> at 18th of 20th with score just at a modest 16% (female 13%, male 8%) — only to be favored by small selects, and is the lowest of all preferences listed here.\nAmong those who are interested to M&amp;T: females are interested to all presented preferences, while male are only interested to some (slice of life, sci-fi, futuristic, action).\nAmong those who are neutral to M&amp;T: female likes other genre/themes more, while males only enjoy few related ones (sci-fi, slice of life, action, crime &amp; detective)\nAmong those who are not interested to M&amp;T: there are shared dislikes of action across both gender and significant likes in slice of life, results of all else does not seem noteworthy.\n\nCategory: ELEMENTS\n\n0% here does not mean unimportant — it only means neutral, negative values actually means rated as unimportant.\nStory is rated virtually an absolute-must among all respondents.\nArt is rated more important among females who are interested to M&amp;T, where as for male is rated more important among those who are not interested to M&amp;T.\nCharacter is rated equally high among all respondents.\nWorldbuilding is rated as moderately important among all who are interested to M&amp;T, although male has slightly higher score than female in general, and females who are not interested to M&amp;T are completely neutral to worldbuilding.\nPlot complexity is rated as moderately important among all who are interested to M&amp;T, although males who enjoys M&amp;T rated plot rated it not as important as others.\nOriginality is rated as moderately important among all who are interested to M&amp;T, although males who are not interested in M&amp;T as much as others has lower score.\nAppeal (cool &amp; cute) is rated as significantly higher in female than male, female has more score the more they are not interested to M&amp;T, while male has large spike in appeal among those who are neutral, and male who are interested or are not interested is completely indifferent to appeal.\n\nTechnically, this should also include &quot;beauty&quot; but the wording is missing — hope this does not affect the results too much.\n\nCategory: CONCEPTS (rank)\n\nFocus on characters' daily life (overall 1st) rated as highest of all, higher rank correlates with them not interested to M&amp;T.\nSoft sci-fi (overall 2nd) has some correlation with interest to M&amp;T among females, whereas male has no notable correlation but has about equal average ranking.\nSide novels (overall 3rd) has anti-correlation with females who are interested to M&amp;T, while there are correlation with male who are interested to M&amp;T.\nNear future settings (overall 4th) has correlation to those who are interested to M&amp;T, correlation is lot more clear and consistent in male than female.\nFuture speculation (overall 5th) has lower rank among those who are interested to M&amp;T for some reason, even though it is literally about future and sci-fi (which plays with the future).\nRobots as human equal (overall 6th) has significantly higher rank among male than female, and there is some correlation between interest to M&amp;T and average ranking of this concept.\nNuances of AIs (overall 7th) rated the lowest of all, those who are not interested in M&amp;T rates higher rank than those who are interested, differences get more significant (and even lower rank) the more they like M&amp;T.",
