- *Blue Rim ("ริมฟ้า", "Rim-faa", "Rim f̂ā"), is a small quaint beachside town located inside Chon Buri province, having a fair share of bountiful seafood cuisine and pristine beach environment. While this town does not receive much attention to other beach tourism hotspots, this still serves as a great alternative choice among beachgoers who prefer a peaceful beach getaway.*
	- Although inspired from a tourism-famous beach town named Pattaya in Chon Buri province, this town is fictional and does not exist. This town will primarily be a location set for future BK003 novel.
- Thailand's beach tourism, internationally famed for its tropical shores and vibrant nightlife, attracts backpackers and beachgoers seeking peaceful summer getaways or chaotic nightlife scenes.
	- While Pattaya’s coastline and Phuket’s island dominate the beach tourism scene, many underappreciated destinations remain hidden gems among Thailand’s tropical offerings.
