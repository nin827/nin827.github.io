*Androids — sapient, humanoid robots with discernible mechanical traits — are a highly influential but controversial subset of the population, and have become integral yet scarce participants in human society. Built with productivity and performance in mind, their skills and expertise have proven to be indispensable — thriving by contributing to the economy and society at large.*

The first batch of androids were created in early 2070s — artificial, mechanical, sapient, humanoid robots. Initially, they lived privately and comfortably, physically isolated from the external world — having all resources and support necessary to live a fulfilling life despite restrictions.

The experimental batch goes smoothly during the stage without any single incidents, to then be slowly exposed to the real world, until late 2080s. By then, despite some resistances, they found their place in some urban cities — being able to thrive by providing valuable services with their newfound skills and abilities.

Few first cities that android lives in include [[MATERIAL/ARTICLE/AR002\|Bangkok]], Tokyo, Shenzhen, Berlin, San Francisco — initially only living in closed-off buildings, then eventually to be free to explore after late 2080s.

After things have properly settled, the [[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000058\|Android Individuality Agreement]] was signed after androids have proved their place and worth to the society, enabling androids' international rights to live and exist as independent individuals.

- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000010\|Artificial intelligence]]**: Androids' artificial intelligence are capable of expressing emotions and comprehending nuances like humans — yet fundamentally distinct due to digital and robotic origins, making them logically-driven in nature.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000008\|Physical & Appearance]]**: Android have many physical design and characteristics similar to a human, but with distinctively-robotic elements and features that clearly sets them apart from humans.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000009\|Mental & Behavior]]**: Androids — despite being a robot — can fully comprehend human emotional, societal, and cultural nuances — and that all androids have their own personalities and individualities.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000011\|Sustenance & Requirements]]**: Androids, like any working machine or organisms, require regular intake of fuel and water — along with diagnostics and maintenance to ensure proper functioning.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000056\|Combat Model]]**: Android combat model, known as "combat android" — are rare subset of androids with upgraded specifications or additional modifications different from average androids — of which are associated in military, security, and criminal settings.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000019\|Production & Deployment]]**: Android's mind are installed into their physical body once the 3-year incubation period is over — are then officially deployed to the society with full autonomy and independence, but has financial obligations to pay back to their manufacturer.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000018\|Life Trajectory ]]**: Androids life trajectory usually starts with a period of training, followed by signing an individual contract for financial support and career boost — to then thrive or survive enough to pay off any obligations they got.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000057\|History & Origins]]**: Androids are first created in early 2070— living privately in a controlled environment, isolated from the external world. It took some effort for them to slowly for the first generation to eventually be recognized by the society by late 2080s.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000013\|Human—Android Coexistence ]]**: Both humans and androids have learned to coexist with each other for the greater benefit as a whole society — androids offers expertise and productivity, while humans offers resources and opportunities.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000032\|Population & Distribution]]**: Android makes up a tiny subset of the world population, at 0.1% of 8 billion population globally — of which are further cross-divided into 24:1 ratio for urban—rural areas and 49:1 ratio for supporting—opposing areas.
