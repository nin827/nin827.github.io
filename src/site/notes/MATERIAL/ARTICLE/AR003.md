- *Ever since the signing of Android Individuality Agreement and internal recognition/acceptance of android, the modern civilization has took a great leap in terms of advancement and development across all major industries. Humans offers developed economy and business opportunities, while androids offers specialized expertise and unparalleled productivity. Due to the existence of aforementioned dynamics, both benefits from each other in a mutually-beneficial relationship and have depend on each unique offerings ever since the common agreement.*
- **The flagship concept**: human and robots coexisting together for mutual benefits.
- Humans offers economy and opportunities; androids offers skills and productivity. The dynamics require for humans as the majority and androids as the minority.
- Android makes up a small minority compared against global population equivalent, further distribution depends how how developed and supportive are those areas. Read more at [[popul\|popul]]
- Due to their high performance and productivity combined with their population scarcity, they are often very sought after in highly specialized workforce.
	- Fortunately, there is not enough to cause human labor disruption in most industries and sectors.
	- Despite their low workforce count, minor protest and unrest still exists in some industries.
- Cognitive performance is significantly different due to androids have higher skill and knowledge potential. Productivity output is very high as androids can work up to 16 hours and is not subjected to stress nor fatigue.
	- In addition to long work hours, they only require up to 4 hours sleep on average which allows them to work more with no drawbacks.
	- Due to how their mind works, all androids can reliably multitask 2 at any given time without performance drops, some could even manage up to 4 at a time but rarely.
- Androids are typically seen in jobs which require high cognitive, precision, and knowledge necessary to perform; includes but not limited to business analytics, brain surgeon, corporate lawyer.
	- Some androids also play a role in military industry and security settings due to their body allowing for some addons and upgrades necessary to function in their role. Read more on [[ART00010\|Android Role in Military and Security]].
- The "robots will take over the world" notion is seen as counterproductive as androids prefer to coexist and reap economic benefits. They thrive from their population scarcity and elevated skillset, these make them a very valuable subset of a population.
	- Should there be too much of them, it would start to create too much internal competition, especially on top few-select positions.
	- Androids do require most of population to be human, as they consume more goods and service for androids to have a market opportunity.
	- Androids thrives on the basis of "asymmetric information", having access to knowledge, skillset, and productivity that no human could ever have.
