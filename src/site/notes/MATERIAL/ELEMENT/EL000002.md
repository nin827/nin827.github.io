## Overview

- *Androids are sapient humanoid robots created to mutually coexist with human civilization, offering elevated performance & productivity in exchange for wealth & opportunities.*
- To put it simply, androids are basically walking sentient computers with humanoid mechanical body, fully capable of expressing emotions and understanding nuances.
- Androids are generally considered as a valuable member of the society — due to their population rarity and skill contributions.
	- However, struggling and destitute androids do exist — but are relatively unseen the public eye.
- Androids are first created in early 2070s but was mostly lived privately and secretly, public appearance and gradual integration into the society only started in mid 2080s.
- Androids can live for 80 years on average, counting after the moment their mind is installed into their physical body due to wear-and-tear and depreciation over time since deployment.
	- Natural causes of death include but not limited to terminal part failure, chronic component degradation, or corrupted memory accumulation, etc.

## Elements

- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000010\|Artificial intelligence]]**: Androids' artificial intelligence are capable of expressing emotions and comprehending nuances like humans — yet fundamentally distinct due to digital and robotic origins, making them logically-driven in nature.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000008\|Physical & Appearance]]**: Android — have many physical design and characteristics similar to a human, but with distinctively-robotic elements and features that clearly sets them apart from humans.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000009\|Mental & Behavior]]**: Androids — despite being a robot — can fully comprehend human emotional, societal, and cultural nuances — and that all androids have their own personalities and individualities.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000011\|Sustenance & Requirements]]**: Androids, like any working machine or organisms, require regular intake of fuel and water — along with diagnostics and maintenance to ensure proper functioning.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000056\|Combat Model]]**: Android combat model, known as "combat android" — are rare subset of androids with upgraded specifications or additional modifications different from average androids — of which are associated in military, security, and criminal settings.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000019\|Production & Deployment]]**: Android's mind are installed into their physical body once the 3-year incubation period is over — are then officially deployed to the society with full autonomy and independence, but has financial obligations to pay back to their manufacturer.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000018\|Life Trajectory ]]**: Androids life trajectory usually starts with a period of training, followed by signing an individual contract for financial support and career boost — to then thrive or survive enough to pay off any obligations they got.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000057\|History & Origins]]**: Androids are first created in early 2070— living privately in a controlled environment, isolated from the external world. It took some effort for them to slowly for the first generation to eventually be recognized by the society by late 2080s.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000013\|Human—Android Coexistence ]]**: Both humans and androids have learned to coexist with each other for the greater benefit as a whole society — androids offers expertise and productivity, while humans offers resources and opportunities.
- **[[MATERIAL/ELEMENT/EL000032\|Population & Distribution]]**: Android makes up a tiny subset of the world population, at 0.1% of 8 billion population globally — of which are further cross-divided into 24:1 ratio for urban—rural areas and 49:1 ratio for supporting—opposing areas.
