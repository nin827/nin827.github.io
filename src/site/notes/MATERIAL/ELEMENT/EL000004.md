- *Biofuel derived from crop and organic biomass stands as a main storage of fuel-energy medium — transforming crops and residues into affordable, renewable, and abundant fuel.*
- Thailand is well known as one of leading sugar exporters in the world and a commercial producer of biofuel derived from sugar canes.
	- Leveraging their sugar cane industry into renewable biofuel energy that proven to be renewable, cost-effective, and highly affordable.
	- Despite their mass production, the supply struggles to keep up with the market demand, leaving them vulnerable to supply shocks.
	- Biofuels are derived from sugar cane, converting biomass into cheap mass-produced fuels at really cheap price with zero consequences.
- Biofuels can be diluted, sweetened, and flavored to produce canned diesel drink — common drink among androids, equivalent somewhere between energy drink and coffee for androids.
- Traditional vehicles are not replaced by electric vehicles due to cheap, sustainable commercialized production of fuels — making them very affordable and overall environmentally-friendly.
	- Electric vehicles does not become obsolete nor niche, but instead remains as an alternative to those who truly want to minimize carbon footprint.

Biofuels are renewable fuels derived from biomass — such as crops, algae, and organic waste — allows energy production and carbon capture at globally commercialized scale.

Biofuel derived from plant-based biomass presents itself as both sustainable and economical liquid energy medium —
