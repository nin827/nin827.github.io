- *Ever since the commercialization of vertical and cellular agriculture, lab-grown food has made food more available, affordable, and accessible to every consumers since 2060s.*
- Artificial food — not flavorings or coloring — is seen as safe, nutritious, affordable, high-quality, despite the perceived laboratory or clinical food production environment.
	- Artificial flavoring or coloring — especially chemically-derived or highly-processed ones still holds a negative perception among consumers.
- With how artificial and cultured food being so common, this has created a market of luxury food products as a side effect — natural and cultivated food.
	- Food quality across both type do not have much difference, but organic products hold great luxury and artisanal value among affluent customers, who often are willing to pay a premium for it.
