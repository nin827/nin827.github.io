The private security office’s backroom hummed with the low whir of cooling fans. It's been only under 48 hours since his memory copy from his human to android body. Vin sat on a repurposed storage crate, staring at his hands — steel and plastic, not flesh.

His human workmate tossed a file onto the desk. "Housing unit’s almost ready. Just need your biometrics — well, your new ones." Vin nodded stiffly. Paperwork. Right.

Across from him, his android workmate unscrewed a can of lager beer and slid it over. "Try this. Refresh yourself with something familiar."

Vin took a cautious sip. He felt the familiar taste of faint malted barley with a hint of bitterness from hops. "Tastes... just like regular old beer."

"For us androids, you can drink beer as much as you want without getting drunk," the android chuckled. "And remember — you just need just a bit of water and stick to dry carbs like bread, crackers, or even paper and wood if you like. Anything mushy’ll clog your intake, beer and soda is fine though."

Vin flexed his fingers. Too light. Too precise. His mind kept misfiring — expecting a familiar sense of fatigue or warmth that never came.

"You'll get used in a week or so," the android said, softer now. "Till then, don’t trust your reflexes."

Outside, Bangkok’s city lights pulsed through the blinds. Vin exhaled—not exactly tired, just letting out a sigh.

"One day at a time," the human muttered, stamping a form.

Vin raised the beer can in mock toast. "I hope, it doesn't feel the same now."

The android grinned. "Now you're one of us — but worry not, it won't be that much different to live as a human."
