> Alone at afternoon, Ella visited a lake to meditate and recollect in her memories of her deceased lover — sitting in silence at a spot where both used to frequent.

It's a warm afternoon, the heat and humidity just right. Ella sits beside a tree by the lake side — her favorite escape from civilization — immersing herself in serene, peaceful embrace of nature.

Ella enjoys her time here every time she visits here — accompanied by the ambience, scenery, and peace by her side.

Leaves brushed rhythmically in the gentle breeze. Sunlight reflects off the pristine lake surface. Sounds of bird calls and chirps audible from a distance.

However, this time is different. She is here alone. She used to visit the lake with her fiancé, who was no longer with her — or this world.

There she was — Ella sitting on a rock, under a tree, beside a lake. She holds a small bouquet of roses in her hands. She sat there peacefully — just reminiscing in her memories with her lover, who she used to sit together with under this very same spot.

Familiar, yet different. Peaceful, but unresolved. Sorrow, not distraught. Sentimental, and nostalgic.

It has been a decent while since his passing. She's had enough time to process her emotions — but appreciates having more time to sort through her thoughts.

Perhaps, she should move on with her life as usual. Yet she could not find her solace — something is missing from her, something did not feel right.

She remained at her spot — with calmness and tranquility.
