Over the next few days, Vin settled into the rhythm of his new body. The stiffness in his movements faded, replaced by smoothness and precision.

His human workmate dropped off the keys to his permanent unit — a compact military-issued pod in the city’s security sector — but Vin kept lingering in the makeshift office. It felt easier, somehow, to stay in limbo.

That evening, the team gathered at a restaurant & bar, clinking bottles under the hum of establishment patrons and nearby traffics. Vin downed his third beer, waiting for the familiar warmth, the slow unraveling of his thoughts. It never came.

Vin recognized the familiar aroma of fried and grilled food around him. He clearly remembered it smelled good, but the smell itself provokes no reaction. No mouth-watering, no hunger, no stomach grows, no physiological reactions, just the association with the senses from his memory.

"You good?" a human colleague slurred, slinging an arm around him.

"Yeah," Vin said, staring at the bottle. "Too good."

His android workmate smirked. "Told you. No drunk, no hangover. Just… hydration and a bit of energy from that alcohol."

The group erupted into laughter, already tipsy, already moving on. Vin forced a grin and ordered another round.

The atmosphere within the team was casual and lively, drinking beverages and just talking among each other. Everyone, including Vin, enjoyed the familiar interactions and rituals between the members.

Later, back at the office, he sat alone, rolling the empty can between his fingers. No buzz. No blur. Just clarity, sharp, and unrelenting.

He missed the numbness, but the flavor and aftertaste of the beer hit him home.

Outside, the city pulsed on, indifferent. Vin vented a slow, unnecessary breath and rested on his chair. Things felt somewhat different, somewhat identical. Nothing too drastic has changed for him, despite him literally being in a new mechanical self.

Some adjustments to be done, it seemed, had nothing to do with the body.
