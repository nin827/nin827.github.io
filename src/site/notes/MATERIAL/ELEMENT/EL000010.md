- *Androids' artificial intelligence are capable of expressing emotions and comprehending nuances like humans — yet fundamentally distinct due to digital and robotic origins, making them logically-driven in nature.*
	- Androids' intelligence are said to be roughly equal to humans on average, but their main advantage are their multitasking skills and short-term memory.
- Androids' mind cannot be hacked remotely by any means, unless if there is direct physical access through opening — secured outer helmet casing and inner plastic covering.
	- Even data and signals received by their ear-receivers are fully sandboxed and sanitized — preventing remote access.
	- There is a single plug behind the back of their head — which androids can plug for lower-level access — protected by physical lid/screw, requires android's conscious effort to function, and is not the true root-level data access point.
- Androids' AI system physically cannot be copied nor duplicated by any means, it can only be created from the base code procedurally developing itself over time.
	- Main reason of being copy-proof is due to the structure and nature of the code — changing ever by the second.
	- Even if an attempt in copying is successful, the replicated code of an android's memory and consciousness would not function at all due to corrupted code.
	- Androids' mind does not malfunction under normal circumstances, but only from serious injuries or syndromes related to the head computer unit.[^1]
