- *Plastic-eating bacteria — created as a sustainable and economical method to breakdown polymer-based materials into organic compounds; however, only works in hot, acidic condition.*
- Plastic-eating bacteria, as the name implies, are bacteria that can metabolize plastic and process it into organic compounds — but only works in hot, acidic conditions.[^1]
- All type of polymers can be safely metabolized and broken down into organic compound, greatly contributing to plastic recycling/disposal and combating waste pollution.
- Due to bacteria being able to actually metabolize them — there are minimal to no concerns of uncontrolled plastic breakdown nor pollution of microplastics into the environment.
- Plastic waste and pollution is no longer much of a concern — provided if there are proper waste management to ensure waste are fully recycled and is not simply dumped into the environment.

[^1]: To be specific, these type of polymer-breakdown properties of these bacteria are only activated in >60°C & pH<3 condition.
