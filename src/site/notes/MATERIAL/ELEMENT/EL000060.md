- *Theory on how birds—parrots/parakeets, crows/ravens, and pigeons/sparrows adapted to the modern urban ecosystem, thriving in food-scarce, navigationally-complex environments. Notable observations are as follows: parrots engage in advanced social interactions—crows demonstrate problem-solving skills—pigeons collaborate in large flocks, although they shy away from humans.*
- Adaptations are observed in middle of 21th century, where urban development really starts taking off, forcing birds to adapt and become smarter.
- Pigeons are highly social birds existing in groups, while not as smart as crows or parakeets, they overcompensate with large-scale coordination to do tasks in perfect unison.
	- Fairly stupid, but not exactly stupid, just slightly more intelligent than pigeons in 2020s.
	- Most of their characteristics remains unchanged since 2020s, other than maybe being a tiny bit smarter than pigeons of the past.
- Crows are known to have intelligence on par with 14-years old humans, capable of solving complex problem, possessing higher knowledge base, and dealing small-scale trades with humans.
	- ...
- Parakeets are capable of having social conversations and interactions with humans within some understanding of Thailand cultural norms, even befriending with some humans and androids.
	- Parakeets are the only species among the other 2 known to voluntarily move in and live with people, only if enough trust is earned from them.
	- Other species can also move in and live with humans like parakeets, but those occurrences are very rare and circumstantial.
- There exists a rare blue-tailed sparrows, typically skittish in nature, but capable of holding long-term grudge and seriously punishes anyone who harmed their fellow species.
	- Extreme infamous cases includes but not limited to burning a house down with a matchstick, wasting their resources by running water taps or electric appliances, and destroying their personal documents.
	- Fortunately, most case are mild in nature, usually involving just terrorizing them on the streets or misplacing their personal belongings.
	- While not confrontational, they are devious and stealthy in nature, making it hard to fend off against them without being fully on guard at all times.
	- Grudges can be forgiven depending on severity of actions committed against them, offerings and time required also depends on the said severity.
	- There is a saying that those sparrows are always watching, hence people being cautious to not mess with them, intentionally or unintentionally.
