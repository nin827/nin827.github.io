- *Android Individual Contracts are schemes that androids can sign to receive investment and benefits during their early years — in return for salary cut after the grace period for several years.*
- After androids' deployment into the physical world and their 6 months of first training — they can choose to sign android individual contract for financial support and career opportunities for first 6 years — in return for 20±10% cut in their income for 12 years after the supportive phase ends.
	- Career path, compensation, benefits, income cut, terms and conditions — all depends on their performance and connections made during the training period.
	- Contracts are about their career path and social status — it is never about ownership of androids as an individual.
	- Financial investment are usually spent back into university degrees, college courses, or accelerated training — aiming to acquire skills quickly during their early years.
- Investor archetype comes as: (1) generic, (2) empathetic, or (3) ruthless. It depends what an android values, some for the peace of mind, some to climb up social ladder, or somewhere in between.
	- Generic investor archetype are the majority — offering standard pay and benefits, and sets manageable performance and expectations. Suitable for average androids.
	- Empathetic investor archetype offers forgiving expectations and social support net—but does not provide much pay, benefits, nor potential to grow their career. Suitable for low-performers, or ones who want relaxed working environment.
	- Ruthless investor archetype offers exceptionally high pay and great career potential—but comes with high expectations, and often works within cut-throat environment. Suitable for high-performer, or ones who want high pay and benefits.
- Contract options comes as follows: (1) generic, (2) specialized, and (3) freelance. It depends if androids prefer flexible contract, or is willing to sacrifice one for more potential, or opt out of one entirely.
	- Generic contract option sets standard benefits and expectations all across the board—while providing them the freedom and flexibility all around. Suitable for any androids.
	- Specialized contract option locks one into specific industries sectors, or companies—but gets to benefit from generous pay with vast support and benefits. Suitable for those who are committed to their decision and knows what they are doing.
	- Freelance contract option — of the lack of one — is not bound by any contract, having no obligations and expectations, but also no funds and benefits. Suitable for those who value freedom and flexibility, but must be entrepreneurial and resourceful.
- Androids who fail to meet performances or committed gross misconduct within their contract can risk serious legal, career, and reputational damage — rare case can lead to prosecution if resulted from catastrophic damage or losses.
