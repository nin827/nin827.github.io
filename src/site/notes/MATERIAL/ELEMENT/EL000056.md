- *Android combat model, known as "combat android" — are rare subset of androids with upgraded specifications or additional modifications different from average androids — of which are associated in military, security, and criminal settings.*
	- Combat model androids are androids specifically fine-tuned and optimized for high performance; however, they only make up 1% of all androids and is subject to strict regulations.
	- Combat androids comes either legally as androids preselected and qualified to join into the security sector for upgrades — or illegally as androids forced or sought out upgrades from black market for their criminal malintent and/or personal gains.
	- Their identity is often kept secret and look identical appearance-wise to regular androids for reasons related to social stigma and blending in with normal people.
	- There are both fear and admiration from society around them — as they are only seen in military, security, and criminal settings — views of them are often polarizing, and combat androids would prefer to not disclose their status. 
- **Legal side**: A small subset of androids are preselected and are given an opportunity join the military/security sector — in exchange for upgrades, add-ons and stable career, but are permanently locked and committed to their duties.
	- In case an android wishes to retire, add-ons would be removed back to initial state, but upgrades are left on under normal circumstances — except powerful upgrades of which must be reversed.
	- Add-ons can be provided on early — but upgrades are only issued to androids who are well committed for life — usually requires 5 years of service and are proven to be highly loyal.
- **Illegal side**: Androids can seek out illegal modifications from black market — such upgrade comes with risk due to questionable parts and service — often done by desperate androids as prerequisite in joining in criminal activities.
	- Only done by truly struggling and desperate androids who are forced in this position, or malicious androids who wants to thrive from criminal activities.
