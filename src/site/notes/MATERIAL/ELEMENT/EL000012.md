> - **Asset Liquidation**: Divest non-core assets, including underperforming retail locations and excess inventory, to generate liquidity. 
> - **Debt Restructuring**: Engage with creditors to refinance existing debt and extend repayment timelines.
> - **Operational Overhaul**: Streamline logistics and marketing operations to eliminate inefficiencies and reduce costs.
> 
> ## 3. Long-Term Contingencies
> - **Bankruptcy Preparation**: Develop a contingency plan for bankruptcy proceedings, including asset valuation and creditor negotiations.
