## Consumables Orientation

Three days into his new existence, Vin found himself seated across from a veteran android security officer at the back of the precinct's break room. A carefully curated assortment of android consumables lay between them on the table, arranged in order of practicality.

At the front-most of the table, there lies a glass of iced water — located closest to Vin. "Take a sip," said the officer. "Cool yourself with a glass of water."

Vin drank about half of the glass — neither too fast nor slow. "Same old, classic water. For humans — or any organisms on earth — it's the solvent for all cellular machineries and processes, including cooling, And for androids — a mechanical equivalent of a human — it's just for cooling internally in our parts, nor externally as exhaling water vapor." The officer lectured in thorough detail about water as sustenance.

The officer slid over a **sugar cracker** first. "Now… Let's start with appetizers. Sweet, dry, crunchy." Vin nibbled the edge, his systems immediately registering the energy boost. Simple and efficient. "Easy to process in your systems, and also something you can share with humans too."

Next came a strip of **dried seaweed**. "Only in small amounts," the officer warned. "And don't drink water before or after - it swells up in your intake valves." Vin took a cautious bite, noting the faint mineral taste. "Tastes... not bad actually", said Vin.

A **sugar cube** followed — pure sweet, flavorless, and energy-dense snacks, but does not store well in warm or humid environment. Then **sugar-glazed paper** — bite-sized, lightly crispy, mildly sweet, but feels funny to eat a sweet paper strips. Then **bamboo sticks** — something that was never edible, now a fun snack to gnaw on and snap with.

The officer then produced some **soft drinks** and **lager beer**, something too familiar and easy to drink. "These go down easy," he said, "note for the beer, alcohol is there as fuel — not drunkenness."

## Fuel—Oxygen Demonstration

"Before we move to other fuel choices — there is something I need to show you", said the officer.

The officer lit a sugar cracker ablaze. "See this? Anything that burns is potential fuel." He trapped the flame under a glass — with barely enough gap for air to pass through. "Same for us. Oxygen feeds our combustion. We can survive without one for an hour before shutdown."

"Without it —," the officer said with a slight pause. "— you'd die." The officer places the glass down on the bowl, the fire died down due to the lack of air.

The demonstration was visceral. Anything that burns well is a fuel. But to burn a fuel, oxygen is requirement to be factored in.

Therefore, the lesson was clear: human and androids shared the same weakness. Only with more room for error.

"Now, we will be moving to other fuels — something you surely would never have thought to consume back when you were a human," said the officer.

## High-Efficiency Fuels 

Things got more interesting when the officer brought out the specialized fuels. He first presented a small bottle of **ethyl alcohol**. "Medical-grade. For us, this is high-density fuel but it sure does taste funny, messing with your taste sensors."

Vin took a swig — no burning sensation, just an immediate feeling of refilling energy reserves. "Highly flammable and energy-rich in our systems," the officer noted. "Great for cold environments or emergencies."

The **biodiesel drink** came next, its murky appearance unappealing. Vin grimaced at his first sip - the flavor was intensely earthy and industrial. "You'll get used to it," the officer assured him. "Standard ration for field ops."

**Coal fragments** proved completely tasteless but packed with slow-release energy. "Chew thoroughly," the officer advised. "Takes longer to process but lasts for hours." Vin bite on a piece — tasteless, earthy, but very crunchy — feeling the steady energy flow registering in his systems.

Finally, the officer produced some **fuelwood shavings** and **dried leaves**. "Last resort fuels," he explained. "Only when stranded with no other options." He demonstrated how to properly clean and prepare them, brushing dirt and drying moisture out. "Dead, dried wood only, anything with sap will gum up your works."

He further added, "I have no wood or leaves samples, but if you insist — there's a tree just outside."

## Adjusting to New Needs

By the end of the session, Vin's energy reserves were optimally filled from testing the various fuels. The officer gave an approving nod. "You'll develop preferences eventually. Most of us can't stand the biodiesel at first either, it's an acquired taste among us androids."

Vin looked down at the assortment of fuels, so different from human food yet serving the same essential purpose. The officer stood up to leave, pausing at the door. "One more thing — don't take it too hard early on, you will get used to your new self with time."

As Vin sat alone in the break room, he picked up another piece of coal, rolling it between his fingers. The future might take some getting used to, but at least he wouldn't go hungry. He popped the coal into his mouth, crunching thoughtfully as he watched the city lights through the window.

Slowly, but gradually getting used to.
