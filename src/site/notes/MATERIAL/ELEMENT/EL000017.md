- *The Indochina Infrastructure Bubble emerged in the late 2190s, fueled by delusional expectations, debt mismanagement, and misplaced trust — eventually snowballed and triggered a catastrophic financial crisis across the region.*
- Takes similar idea and inspiration from **[Asian Financial Crisis]([1997 Asian financial crisis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis))** (1997): A regional economic collapse triggered by Thailand's currency devaluation, spreading across Southeast/East Asia due to excessive foreign debt, speculative attacks, and weak financial systems, leading to IMF bailouts, recessions, and structural reforms. (Summarized by DeepSeek, 08/02/2025)
- The Indochina Infrastructure Bubble happened in April 2198 — attributed mostly from uncontrolled growth, poorly-managed debt, overly-optimistic expectations, and most importantly — a poorly timed economic shock that spooked the market and investors, causing major economic cascade throughout the entire region.
	- This crucial plot point strictly follows the statement "those who forget history are condemned to repeat it" sharing many similar characteristics and elements with the actual financial bubble.
