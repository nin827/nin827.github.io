- *Bangkok, Thailand, one of the bustling city centers within continental Southeast Asia — positioned itself as one of few major hub in finance, technology, and commerce. The capital city also serves as one of forefronts for android—human coexistence, where either of them are legally treated with equality and dignity.*
- Bangkok is rather lopsided in terms of economic development, population size, and business opportunities relative to other cities in Thailand.
- Bangkok is one of the most visited cities in the world in terms of tourism — considering that Thailand's push for soft power and cultural influence, earning significant portion of GDP from tourism and hospitality industry.
	- For this reason, any disruption to the capital city can bottleneck the entire country — whether due to blocked roads, social unrest, or logistical issues.
	- Thailand has one of the highest primacy ratio, measuring at 12.3, comparing between Bangkok 13.5M and Chiang Mai 1.1M population.[^1]
- The city is located rather low away the sea level, rendering Bangkok especially prone to flooding and heavy rains, and is at serious risk to rising sea levels.
- Well-developed in terms of civil infrastructures and amenities — including but not limited to sprawling road highways, integrated metro railways, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings.
	- Despite all developments, many residential area still remains unchanged, including notorious narrow roads with no pedestrian paths to walk on.
- Like any countries within Southeast Asia, Thailand is not entirely free from corruption or nepotism — but at least the fact is somewhat compensated with economic development and prosperity.

[^1]: Using real world data as reference, population by cities would be as Bangkok 11.4M and Chiang 1.2M in year 2025.
