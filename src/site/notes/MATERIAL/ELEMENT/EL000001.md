- *Bangkok, Thailand, one of the bustling city centers within Southeast Asia continent — a major hub for commerce, tourism, and culture. The country positioned itself as one of the leading producers of rice, sugar, lab-grown food, and biofuels of the century.*
- Bangkok is rather lopsided in terms of economic development, population size, and business opportunities relative to other cities in Thailand.
	- For this reason, any disruption to the capital city can bottleneck the entire country — whether due to blocked roads, social unrest, or logistical issues.
	- Thailand has one of the highest primacy ratio, measuring at 12.3, comparing between Bangkok 13.5M and Chiang Mai 1.1M population.[^1]
- Bangkok is one of the most visited cities in the world in terms of tourism — considering that Bangkok likes to push for soft power, and earns significant portion of GDP from tourism industry.
- The city is located rather low away the sea level, rendering Bangkok especially prone to flooding and heavy rains, and is at serious risk to rising sea levels.
- Well-developed in terms of civil infrastructures — including but not limited to sprawling road highways, integrated metro railways, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings.
	- Despite all developments, many residential area still remains unchanged, including notorious narrow roads with no pedestrian paths to walk on.
- Like any countries within Southeast Asia, Bangkok or Thailand as rife with corruption nor nepotism — but at least the fact is somewhat compensated with economic development and prosperity.

[^1]: Using real world data as reference, population by cities would be as Bangkok 11.4M and Chiang 1.2M in year 2025.
