- *How food grown from organic environment and traditional method became choice of luxury — making organic food a highly coveted and premium product among affluent consumers.*
- Organic products has elevated to become the food choice of wealthy consumers, ever since the widespread commercialization of lab-grown food since 2060s.
- These type of products are often presented as premium, luxurious, traditional, artisanal—further mark up added by sheer rarity, perceived quality, and methods involved.
	- Price markup varies from ×2 times as expensive just for the fact it is natural, to ×10 times or greater as expensive for rarity/labor/resource/time-intensive products.
- Some products like saffron, caviar, and truffles remains scarce due to irreproducibility/rarity, and still fetch a massive price tag only affordable to the truly wealthy customers.
- Natural food/ingredients remains a commonplace in upscale grocery stores, premium restaurants, fine dining, and gastronomy experience — of which are out of reach for ordinary people.
