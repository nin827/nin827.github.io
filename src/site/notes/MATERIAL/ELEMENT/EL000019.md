- *Android's mind are installed into their physical body once the 3-year incubation period is over — are then officially deployed to the society with full autonomy and independence, but has financial obligations to pay back to their manufacturer.*
- Android's physical body specifications are preset and predetermined according to AGI seed — includes gender, height, weight, strength, speed, intellect, etc.
	- Transgender does not exist among androids as they can just choose their desired gendered body from the start. This decision will also change all other physical attributes according to gender average adjustment standards.
	- Manufacturers cannot change physical specifications by law, even if requested by an android themselves — but androids can get further body modifications after being born to their preferences.
- Post-incubation period, many of them will start working in a first training position for 6 months — mostly to build work experiences and references for their next position.
	- Androids are advised to apply for a first training position as soon as possible to gain experiences and recommendations for smooth transition to their first job.
- Androids are highly advised to take an [[PN000007\|individual contract]] to help offset cost of their physical body — of which costs average of 20,000–40,000 USD, and are expected to be paid during their lifetime, with payments done on a quarterly basis.[^1]
	- Therefore, simply having a job and skipping the contract out might not be ideal — unless if they either got good paying job early, negotiated for payment reduction or extension, or got necessary connections to pay for or eliminate obligations entirely.
	- There are grace interest-free period which is usually within first 5 years post-deployment, after which 1–2% amortized interest payments plus 20–100 USD administration fees will be incurred every quarter.
- Androids are only produced in small quantities throughout the year — averaging around 2,000 in biweekly intervals — with factories residing in isolated locations throughout the world.
- Androids who are qualified for their behavior/characteristics/mindset can be preselected to join the military/security sector — upon signing a contract, they will be committed to their duties, in exchange of an [[PN000056\|upgraded physical body]] and [[PN000034\|stable lifetime career]] — all fully sponsored by the government.
