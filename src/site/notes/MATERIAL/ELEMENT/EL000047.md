> Alone at midnight, Vin visited a cemetery alone to mourn and pay respects to the grave of his previous dead self — not exactly sure how he should feel nor process this moment.

It is near midnight. The cemetery was quiet — with occasional noise from cricket chirps and blowing leaves. Vin took a moment of his night to walk to the cemetery — where the grave of his old human self resides.

From the entrance, he slowly but steadily walked to where he meant to arrive. He stopped in front of a simple stone — holding a single white flower in his hands.

For a moment, he just stood there in silence — then kneeled on the cold, wet grass.

He then leaned inwards and carefully placed a white flower on the stone.

The grave was written with the name he knew too well, and dates he felt too close together.

It was a weird feeling for Vin. Technically, it was him — yet, not him. He is alive standing above the grave — yet, dead resting below the ground. Here he was, android self paying respects to human self.

He did not feel any melancholy nor sorrow — just sentiments of his previous life. It was an unusual thought for Vin to mentally process.

He remained there for few minutes. It felt like several minutes to him.

The night stretched on, endless and indifferent.

Then he turned and walked away, leaving the dead to their silence.
