The scent of lemongrass and charred meat hit Vin the moment he pushed open the restaurant’s glass door. The place was half-full — murmurs of conversation, the sizzle of pork on the grill, the clatter of plates. Behind the counter, Ella wiped her hands on her apron, her brow glistening under the kitchen lights. Short-staffed, like always.

Vin hesitated at the doorway, then forced himself forward.

She didn’t look up.

He slid onto a stool at the counter, the metal cool under his palms. Ella turned, pen poised over her notepad. "What’ll it be?"

Her voice was the same.

Vin looking at her for a second, "Just a beer. Whatever’s cold."

She nodded, scribbling. "Singha or Chang?"

"Singha." Vin's favorite.

She moved away without a second glance.

The beer arrived in a frosted can. No glass. Vin peeled back the tab, the sound too loud in his own ears. He took a sip. Same old taste, but alcohol has no effect this time.

Ella bustled past him, shouting an order to the kitchen. A strand of hair escaped her ponytail. She blew it out of her face with the same exasperation he remembered.

Vin’s fingers tightened around the can.

She didn’t recognize him. Of course she didn’t.

He was steel now. A stranger with his voice, his memories, his face — reshaped but not remade.

The beer was half-finished when Ella paused in front of him again. "Need anything else?"

Vin shook his head. "No, thank you."

She smiled — polite and friendly — and promptly turned away.

He didn't bothered to ask for a bill, opting to just leave a bill on the counter. Too much, but it's a generous tip.

Somewhere behind him, Ella laughed at something a customer said.

He took a quick glance back at her, then left the restaurant shortly after.
