- *Androids, like any working machine or organisms, require regular intake of fuel and water — along with diagnostics and maintenance to ensure proper functioning.*
	- Requires oxygen, water, fuel & food, powder metal mix, along with 4 hours a day of "sleep" as absolute minimum physiological needs for proper bodily functions.
	- Due to their fuel/food being catalyzed or processed, they do require oxygen to process those fuels — like how fire needs oxygen to burn.
	- Androids also require small amount of water for passive cooling system, which works by passively exhaling warm water vapor to ventilate excess heat off.
	- Powder metal mix are typically ingested in capsule pill forms, which are used to repair their body with their nano-bots functioning inside their body.[^1]
	- Only 4 hours of "sleep" or self-maintenance is required a day to restore all their internal systems back to it's default state.
- Common fuel/food choice among androids are sugar crackers, soft drinks, canned biodiesel, dried seaweed, bamboo sticks, etc.
	- Generally, they prefer dry energy-dense medium as it is easier to process, include but not limited to sugar crackers, soft drinks, canned biodiesel, dried seaweed, bamboo sticks, etc.
	- They always avoid food high in protein and water content to avoid fuel processing issues — foods with these characteristics are hard for their systems to process and may cause blockage.
	- Androids could taste and smell like humans, although they lack the physiological response and simply perceive the sense as is.
- Androids do use/consume miscellaneous products including but are not limited to (1) powder metal mix pills, (2) facial plastic maintainer creams, (3) canned deactivated diesel drinks, (4) anti-dust hygienic products, and (5) ear-plug electronic add-ons.
	- A small pill of alloy and carbon mix per month will suffice for average androids' maintenance system, more are needed if injured or doing heavy physical works.
	- An android requires an average daily intake of 2000cal of energy and 50ml of water, as average basal metabolic rate with requirement scaling according to circumstances.[^2]
- To ensure proper function and performance, androids are recommended to do a check-up with authorized technicians to perform diagnostics and maintenances every 1–2 years on average.
	- Androids that do none—light physical work require 2 year visit intervals, while ones that does moderate—heavy physical works require 1 year visit intervals or more frequent.

[^1]: Nanobots only function inside their body to do micro-repairs and clean up dust debris — not capable of any work outside their work due to requiring energy.
