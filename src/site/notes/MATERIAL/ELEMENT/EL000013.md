- *Both humans and androids have learned to coexist with each other for the greater benefit as a whole society — androids offers expertise and productivity, while humans offers resources and opportunities.*
	- Android excels the most in terms of work productivity, performance — attributed to how their mind works fundamentally.
	- Humans still participate in the society as usual, but their demand and consumption are what fuels the economy.
- Due to androids being a tiny minority of the global population and them being highly productive — for this reason, they are widely deemed as valuable and irreplaceable part of the society.
	- Stigma, discrimination, and hostility do exist against androids — but they only exist in isolated case, more commonly observed outside urban settings.
	- Androids and humans sometimes compete in the same labor market, and there are reports of opposition between either sides.
- For the most part, androids do not replace humans in anyway, they only augment the society with their expertise and productivity — they require each other to thrive in the advanced economy.
	- Hypothetically, androids would not survive if humans were to be gone for any reason — they require thriving market fueled by humans' demand and consumption.
	- Therefore, the notion of "robots taking over the world" would be counter-productive, androids would be worse off if humans are all gone.
