> Vin trying out a Grilled Beef Skewer flavor wafer he bought from a convenience store; he was all familiar with the complex taste, but the lack of texture made the eating experience rather off.

Vin stood in the dim glow of the convenience store shelves, turning the flavor wafer package in his hands. The label promised "Grilled Beef Skewer  — doubtful, but worth a try. He grabbed one for himself, then paid at the cashier.

Back on the street, he unwrapped the thin, crisp wafer. No aroma — but the moment it touched his tongue, his taste receptors lit up. Charred meat. Soy sauce. Fish sauce. Coriander. Chili.

The flavors exploded with how he remembered, every spice note replicated perfectly—almost, there is no texture or mouthfeel. No chew, no grease, just taste.

But for three seconds, he’d tasted home.  

Vin crumpled the wrapper, tossing it into a bin. The aftertaste lingered, synthetic but familiar. He’d come back for more. Not for energy — just to remember how real food tasted like.  

Nearby, he spotted a street vendor flipped meat skewers over coals — of which includes a beef skewer he just tasted. Vin walked past and glanced by, hands in pockets, the ghost of flavor still on his tongue.  

The taste was great. But he did not feel anything too strongly about it.
