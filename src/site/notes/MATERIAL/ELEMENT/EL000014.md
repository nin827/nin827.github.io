- *Silverthorne Syndicate, a criminal organization notorious for fraud and espionage within Indochina countries — involving manipulation, extortion, and deceits, and primarily engages behind the shadows.*
- Emerged from the economic fallout of the Indochina Infrastructure Bubble, the syndicate specializes in discreetly destabilizing small-to-midsize financial firms through forged audits, insider trading, and strategic leaks.
- The syndicate’s decentralization and anonymity make tracking nearly impossible, method includes but are not limited to disposable identities, forged credentials, appearance changes, and counter-sabotaging tracking attempts through cybersecurity warfare.
- The group has agents and bodyguards as means of physical defense against confrontational attempts — along with leader himself whose capable of simultaneously operating four weaponized drones as means of frontline support and defensive measure.
- Led by a former executive of a defunct logistics medium-sized company — having deep knowledge in supply chain, corporate finance, and cybersecurity — the group avoids flashy crimes, preferring to quietly drain assets from struggling startups and regional enterprises. 
- Due to leader's prior knowledge in logistics, finance, and cybersecurity, the syndicate is able to exploit to commit frauds and espionage — opportunistically preying on failing small-medium business, siphoning their material and assets for their greater ambitions.
- Many corrupt actors has worked with members of the syndicate as means to gain more power and wealth, some to sabotage their business rivals, some to gain greater national influence, or some to simply satisfy their ill-intent deeds.
- Law enforcement unofficially and reluctantly *tolerates* their activities as a "self-regulating market force," believing their selective predation weeds out unstable businesses while avoiding destabilizing headlines.
