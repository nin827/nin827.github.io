## Vin’s Perspective

The security team’s training drills had shifted from tactical simulations to something more casual — a makeshift football match on the public field. Everyone, including Vin himself were on the field having fun with a football match.

One of his officers jogged over, catching his breath. "Damn, remember how Vin used to fake that left turn? Swear he pulled it on me every time."

"Yeah. Annoying as hell." Vin responded, with a slight bit of delay.

The man laughed, nudging him. "Mind showing us here how it’s done?"

Just across the street, he noticed someone too familiar not too far away — Ella, walking along the sidewalk beyond the fence, arms loaded with restaurant supply bags. She wasn’t looking their way.

"Alright, enough nostalgia," Vin said, louder than necessary. "Let's switch it up to something else."

Groans followed, but the team complied, shifting focus. Vin didn’t turn to watch Ella’s reaction.

He didn’t need to — Vin shifted his focus back to the game.

## Ella’s Perspective

The weight of the grocery bags made Ella’s arms ache as she passed the football field. She wouldn’t have glanced over at all if not for the familiar voices — ones she hadn’t heard in months.

"— Vin used to fake that left turn —"

Her head snapped up.

There they were — Vin’s old security unit, the same group that used to crowd her bar after shifts. They were running drills, laughing between plays. One of them had just said his name.

Her chest tightened.

Of course they’d talk about him. They’d worked together for years. It made sense they’d reminisce while training.

She slowed and looked at them for few seconds, watching them continue playing football and just having some fun.

Something prickled at the back of her mind, but she shoved it down.

She does miss him — but there is no point to yearn for someone that is gone.

Just old friends remembering old tricks. Nothing more.

Adjusting her grip on the bags, she walked on with increased pace.
