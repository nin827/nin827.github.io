The restaurant was closed for renovations during the weekend, the chairs stacked on tables and the scent of fresh paint hanging in the air. Ella stood by the bar, tapping her tablet as she reviewed the blueprint for the new counter layout. The door chimed, and she looked up to see "Ben" standing there, a toolbox in one hand and a folded piece of paper in the other.

"Hey," he said, stepping inside. "Got a minute?"

Ella blinked. "Ben? What’s up?"

He scratched the back of his head — a gesture that, if she looked closely, was eerily familiar. "So, uh. I lost a bet."

"A bet?"

"Years ago. To Vin." The name hung in the air for a second before he continued, voice deliberately casual. "Just small football match bet. But the deal was, loser had to help you out if you ever redid this place." He held out the note. "Found it in my old gear. Figured I should honor it."

Ella took the paper, unfolding it carefully. The handwriting was unmistakable — Vin’s messy scrawl, complete with his habit of looping the "y" too wide.

"Ben lost the bet. Help Ella with cleaning/fixing her restaurant. Get her signature as proof of work. —Vin"

Dated two years ago.

She stared at it, then at "Ben." "You kept this?"

He shrugged. "Forgot about it until I was cleaning out my stuff. But a promise is a promise."

Ella laughed softly, shaking her head. "God, that sounds like him. Always terrible with picking the right team." She pocketed the note. "Well, I won’t say no to free labor. You sure you don’t mind?"

"Nah. Besides, I owe him."

She grinned. "Then welcome aboard. And since you’re being so nice about it, I’ll even throw in extra pay."

"Not necessary —"

"No, we don't do unpaid labor here — it would be… distasteful, don't you think?." She tossed him a paint roller. "Now, you any good with this?"

"Ben" caught it, his grip steady. "Easy work for me."

As they got to work, Ella didn’t notice how he hesitated before touching the bar’s edge — the same spot Vin had once carved their initials into, back when they were reckless and human.

For now, it was just a favor. A kept promise.

And if Ella’s smile was a little brighter when she handed him a can of beer — drinking on the job is not an issue, since androids just could not get drunk.

Vin’s fingers paused mid-stroke as the roller brushed against the edge of the bar. There, nearly hidden by years of varnish and wear, were the initials he’d carved into the wood long ago — V+E, rough and uneven.

"I think someone scribed something here, sand it out?" he asked, voice carefully neutral.

Ella glanced over from where she was measuring the new countertop. "Hm? Oh, oh — no, leave it be." She crouched beside him, tracing the letters with her fingertip. "It’s part of the place’s history. Just paint lightly over it so it’s still there, underneath."

Vin delayed his response slightly. "Sentimental?"

"Practical," she corrected, standing. "Regulars love that kind of thing. ‘Oh, look, the old bartender and his girlfriend — " She caught herself, shaking her head. "Well, best to keep there for aesthetics."

He nodded, applying the thinnest coat possible. The letters blurred under the paint but didn’t disappear.

By the time they finished, the bar gleamed under the work lights — fresh, but still familiar. Ella wiped her hands on her jeans and disappeared into the back, returning with a carton of 24 large beer cans.

"For you," she said, dropping it into his arms. "Consider it your ‘extra pay.’"

Vin blinked. "This is… a lot."

"No guilt, it’s a month from expiration — I need to get rid of it, but throwing it out would be a waste," she shrugged. "Treat yourself, or your friends if you must."

He hesitated. "No thanks, I-"

"I know." She grinned. "But it's the establishment rule to provide excellent service to… loyal customers," she gave a wink.

The name hung between them. Vin adjusted his grip on the carton, the cans clinking softly. "Well, can't say no to free beer then. Thanks, Ella."

Ella patted his shoulder — a casual, fleeting touch, handing the note back with her signature as honorable proof of work — as she walked past. "See you around, Ben."

The door swung shut behind her.

Vin then returned to his housing unit promptly after, sat alone in his room and staring down the signed note. Then he popped open a beer, the hiss of carbonation loud in the quiet.

He couldn’t get drunk. He enjoyed the beer regardless.
