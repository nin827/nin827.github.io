1. Illustration for book medium will be produced as minimally refined sketch style to establish the aesthetic and optimize the process, cleanup and refining must be kept to the minimum.
	1. Illustration sketching steps are [1] 15 min. on sketch foreground, [2] 5 min. to sketch background, [3] 5 min. to fill coloring layers, and [4] 5 min. on fill line shadings |; expected result must be minimally refined quality and take total average of 30 minutes.[^1]
	2. Illustration finalization checklist are [1] set all layer opacity to 100%, [2] lock content folder and overlay folder, [3] keep folder selection on the sketch layer, [4] export draft as canvas format as 32-bit PNG, [6] export and backup draft to **OneDrive**, and [7] re-save with **paint.net** as **32-bit PNG only**.[^1]
2. It is important to maintain consistent quality and optimized workflow, to be able to produce illustrations predictable in quality and speed; refer to child list as it is not possible to summarize everything in an entry.
	1. Illustrations for all mediums are to be sized 1.2-inch for every 512-pixel; but it can also be for 256-pixel if for high-resolution version; when creating samples out of canvas illustration, be sure to select area based on units of sub-block, which is 32x32-pixel each.
3. Canvas illustrations can have one, three, or six thumbnail illustrations for small, medium, and large draft size, respectively.
	1. Assuming a block is equivalent to 256x256 pixels, [1] a small canvas is 8x6 blocks or 2048x1536 pixels, [2] a medium canvas draft is 12x8 blocks or 3072x2048 pixels, and [3] a large canvas draft is 16x12 blocks or 4096x3072 pixels; refer to the footnote for list of canvas layouts.
	2. A chapter must contain 6 standard thumbnails, and up to 12 smaller thumbnails can be used freely; do be sure that all thumbnail illustrations of a chapter fit in a single large canvas.
	3. Medium standard thumbnail canvas is a standard for settings and scenarios, it is expected to be arranged as focus, main, and extra in order from left to right. A large collage thumbnail is to be used in illustrating novels, is expected to be arranged from top-left to bottom-right in order of per chapter.
4. Default illustration style will be [1] greyscale, [2] unrefined, [3] pixelated, [4] technical, and [5] matured (manga-oriented), or simply termed (at least personally) as **quick-sketch** style.[^2]
5. Illustrations, or specifically thumbnail illustrations, will be used as visual aid to help illustrate the idea and scene in an excerpt of a novel.
6. Standard size for thumbnails is expected to be 2x2 size, though, smaller (1x1, 1x2, or 2x1) sizes will also be used occasionally.
7. Names for thumbnail sizes are as following: [1] **standard** for 2x2, [2] **small** for 1x1, [3] **wide** for 2x1, and [4] **tall** for 1x2.

[^1]: Intentionally add various sketch-artifacts if an illustration is too clean by quickly and roughly retrace it achieve a quick-sketch effect, but also accurately and properly avoid messy-sketch effect. In case when an illustration is too refined, try retracing (quickly, roughly, and leniently) starting from base frame, outer outline, and inner outline in respective order. However, do not use transform-resize or enable anti-aliasing, avoid scribbling excessively to obfuscate details, and not create any stray or missing lines and fills.

[^2]: Regarding the greyscale-colored point, illustrations will use only 9-step greyscale color which includes 0, 31, 63, 95, 127, 159, 191, 223, and 255 in 16-bit values. Regarding all three other points, simply do a quick sketch with a manga style in mind but with anti-aliasing disabled.
