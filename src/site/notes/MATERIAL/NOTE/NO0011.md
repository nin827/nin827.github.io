- This vault uses **Noto Sans** and **Noto Sans Mono** font, both of which are open-source and free for commercial use.
- All characters and concepts must have an accompanying icon; the icon also must strictly follow 1x1 size, grayscale coloring, and smooth-sketch line style.
- All characters must have at least one accompanying main thumbnail illustration related to their focus on either routine, career, and leisure setting in their default state.
	- A character can have up to bonus of 12 bonus thumbnail illustrations (separate from main ones) linked in the character's page. Numbers exceeding the amount will have to be linked to separate bonus document instead.
