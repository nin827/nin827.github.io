media literacy, reading, understanding, cognition, thinking, author, audience
1. Fiction is fiction; reality is reality.
2. Fictional thing/event/idea does not happen/exist in real life.
3. Real thing/event/idea does happen/exist in real life.
4. Fiction is not reality; reality is not fiction.
5. Reality has evidence and facts; fiction relies on imagination and narrative.
6. Not everything are described literally, try to read the room or implied meaning.
7. Real-life influences on fiction don’t make the fiction itself factual.
8. Fiction can draw inspiration from reality; every fiction has different level of "trueness" in it.
9. What is written is an interpretation from an author, not an endorsement/opinion from an author.
10. Fiction can reflect real-life themes without being directly based on real events.
11. Fiction can explore hypotheticals or alternate realities that don’t exist.
12. Fiction can be meaningful and impactful without being literally true.
13. Reality can sometimes feel stranger than fiction, but that doesn’t make fiction real.
14. Authors use exaggeration, symbolism, and metaphor — not everything is meant literally.
15. Just because something feels emotionally true doesn’t mean it happened in reality.
16. Audiences bring their own interpretations, which may differ from the creator’s intent.
17. Separating fiction from reality requires critical thinking, not just surface-level observation.
18. Media creators have biases and perspectives that shape how stories are told.
19. Always question who benefits from a story being told a certain way.
20. Context are meaning explicitly written in text, 
21. Things to consider: (1) what really happened, (2) what is the intention, (3) what is the context, and (4) how it is portrayed?

> [!NOTE]- Note: Extra Points to Consider
> 1. If the author writes all good things, it would be boring to read with no stakes.
> 2. Fictional characters' choices serve the plot, not real free will — their 'decisions' are author constructs.
> 3. Problematic things exist in a story to make you feel unease and root for a resolution.
> 4. Characters may act inconsistently when the story requires it, because authors prioritize themes over realism.
> 5. Fiction can explore hypothetical versions of real figures that would be unethical to suggest about actual people.
> 6. Some stories create entirely detached political systems for worldbuilding, not commentary of real-world issues.
> 7. Many people consume fiction to mentally ‘check out’ from real-world stress — not to engage with heavy themes.
> 8. Audiences often project real-world politics onto stories, even when creators didn’t intend it.
> 9. Some concepts are more sensitive than others, and may require extra caution in portrayal.
> 10. A story can critique an idea by showing its consequences, not just by saying it’s bad.
> 11. The same act can be framed as heroic or monstrous depending on perspective.
> 12. Just because bad things were written does not mean the author support nor endorse it.
> 13. It is wrong to assume a character’s trait reflects the creator’s beliefs, not the story’s needs.
> 14. Fictional characters can be reduced to symbols, while real people cannot.
> 15. Audiences might conflate fictional relationships with real-life ideals, ignoring narrative context.
> 16. Don't do what you see in the media or on the internet, take a moment and think first. Think.
> 17. Real-life parallels in fiction don’t mean 1:1 allegories.
> 18. Ask: Is this story inviting me to question something, or just to accept it?
> 19. Don’t blame fiction for real-world problems — but don’t ignore its cultural impact either.
> 20. It’s fine to emotionally invest in fiction, but remember: no fictional character needs your 'protection'—they’re not real.
> 21. Fictional characters are narrative tools, not sentient beings—debating their 'morality' is like judging a chess piece’s motives.
> 22. Headcanons are fun, but treating them as canon leads to unnecessary conflict with creators and other fans.

>[!info] Tips: Simple Things to Keep in Mind
>- When you don't know something, try search it up online or POLITELY ask for explanations.
>- When you don't know what that word is, search "define WORD" or read the surrounding context.
>- It is best to avoid having strong opinions until you are at least 90% sure about it, keep it in for a while first.
>- Know that your opinion or knowledge may not be 100% perfect, be open to changes, but also hold your grounds.
>- Preferences has no rights or wrongs, but opinions can have rights or wrongs depending on the knowledge built upon.
>- By issuing death threats, you are positioning them as a sympathetic victim and undermines your cause (even if reasonable/valid). Also, you are doing a jerk move, please don't.
