# TO BE REWORKED

- His routine teeters between freelance photography for clients, idle wandering through the urban streets, and casual photography capturing every corner of the city. He enjoys living in the moment and prefers his highly flexible lifestyle, avoiding rigid schedules while prioritizing tasks that suits his lifestyle. ==Freedom & Flexibility — Routine==
    - Balances freelance income between travel expenses and savings, leveraging seasonal gig spikes to offset quieter periods while avoiding debt through disciplined, unpretentious budgeting habits.
    - Rejects societal pressures to “scale up” his freelance work, opting instead for small, manageable gigs that fund his travels and allow uninterrupted periods of observational downtime.
    - Despite his carefree demeanor, Simon is meticulous about his finances, tracking income and expenses with a simple yet effective system that ensures he’s never caught off guard by slow gig periods.
    - He’s known among friends and clients for his reliability, often going the extra mile to deliver quality work without making a fuss or expecting excessive praise.
    - Simon’s minimalist approach extends beyond his gear and finances to his lifestyle, valuing experiences and relationships over material possessions or status symbols.
- Simon lives by his freelance photography and minimalist lifestyle, with clients ranging from small businesses to travel agencies. He negotiates fiercely for creative freedom, often delivering beyond expectations while secretly curating a personal portfolio of unreleased, experimental shots. ==Freelance Photography — Career==
    - Maintains a vast but low-key network of connections through casual café meetups, social media engagement, and unspoken reciprocity, avoiding formal networking events or transactional relationships.
    - His freelance work focuses on event photography, product shoots, and travel vlogs, preferring short-term gigs over long contracts to maintain flexibility and fund his wanderlust without being tied down by rigid schedules or obligations.
    - Approaches clients with detached professionalism, delivering quality work without emotional investment, often shooting backup compositions secretly for his portfolio during rigid assignments.
    - He avoids over-editing his photos, preferring natural tones and minimal filters, which gives his work an authentic, unfiltered quality that resonates with his audience.
    - Photography funds his travels, and travel fuels his photography; it’s a self-sustaining cycle where work and leisure blur, allowing him to live unanchored while documenting the world on his terms.
- His leisure and work blur seamlessly — a photo shoot doubles as a walking tour, a café visit becomes a scouting trip. His blog serves less as a branding tool and more as a visual diary of Bangkok’s hidden corners, updated sporadically between his travels and photography. ==Travel & Photo Blog — Leisure==
    - Documents Bangkok’s layered cityscapes using minimalist gear, favoring rooftop vantage points and street-level candids that blend artistic spontaneity with technical precision honed through years of practice.
    - He has a knack for finding quiet, overlooked spots in bustling urban areas, often using these locations as backdrops for his shoots or as places to unwind and reflect.
    - Simon’s travel philosophy revolves around serendipity — he rarely plans trips in detail, instead allowing chance encounters and spontaneous decisions to shape his journeys.
