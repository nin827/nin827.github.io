	- Meticulously organizes his workstation with color-coded data drives, dismissing colleagues’ jokes about his “analog tendencies,” insisting a clutter-free environment reduces cognitive load during complex data audits.
	- Spends evenings assembling vintage model kits with painstaking care, finding calm in the tactile process — a contrast to his screen-dominated workdays analyzing sales trends.
	- Maintains a spreadsheet tracking collectible market trends, casually browsing auction sites during coffee breaks but denying any intent to monetize his hobby.
	- Prefers hand-painting model details over 3D printing, quietly amused by friends’ confusion about why he enjoys such “inefficient” craftsmanship.
	- Volunteers for extra report cross-verification, believing flawless work will offset his hesitation in team discussions about creative strategies.
	- Stores rare model parts in labeled plastic bins under his bed, organized by era and rarity, though he insists it’s “just casual collecting.”
	- Sometimes delays submissions triple-checking minor data points, earning respect for accuracy but frustrating managers needing quick turnaround on routine analyses.
	- Fixes coworkers’ malfunctioning tablets during breaks, downplaying it as “basic diagnostics” while hoping it builds rapport beyond his junior role.
	- Logs daily task completion rates in a private database, adjusting work rhythms to avoid productivity dips, though he won’t admit it borders on compulsive.
