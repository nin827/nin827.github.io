- Ella was in a relationship with [[MATERIAL/CHARACTER/CR043\|Vin]] while he was alive as a human; unfortunately, he succumbed to his injuries during his missions and lost her beloved one. While Vin was able to live again as an android and attempt to make contact with Ella, she was not aware of his true identity which he kept it as secret for confidential reasons.
	- During their interactions after his passing, Vin (as an android) did reminded her of her lover who passed away but she only brushed off as both being friends and sharing some similiarities.
	- Ella initially knew Vin (as android) as Ben when he visited her establishment. She also did also help Vin with some finances as she thought both were close friends and knew he had "just moved in". Though, he only took some of the help and declined the rest to not inconvenience her any further.
