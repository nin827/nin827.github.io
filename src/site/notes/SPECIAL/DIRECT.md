# Material

>[!empty]
> ![RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/PlaceholderIcon.png|icon](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/PlaceholderIcon.png)◆ This is written as my — nin827 — perspectives, visions, experiences, thoughts, and directions with the Project NS22 — laying out in detail on what, which, why, and how should it be done.

- This project, __New Siam 22th Century__, abbreviated __NS22__, is a novel project owned by __nin827__. ==OWNERSHIP==
	- The ownership of this project and assets, including artwork and writing, shall be majority owned by __nin827__ only. Unless specifically stated for certain materials, which credits will be given accordingly per contributing party.
		- Other users can contribute certain part of the project, such as character/concept/entry or certain part of chapter. Of which, they will receive credits accordingly.
		- Such material are allowed to be used outside of NS22 as necessary, provided the surrounding context is distinct enough and is not used in disparaging/malicious manner.
	- Book/novel/blog ownership rights in English language, and intellectual ideas & concepts of the project belong solely to **nin827**; credits of specific materials can be shared to other contributing user/group, if any.
		- In simple words: idea owned by nin827 and other, if any, books owned by nin827, novel owned by nin827, blog owned by nin827, other medium owned by whoever.
	- Ownership rights outside book/novel/blog medium will be up to the publishing entity holding the ownership, and requires **nin827**'s approval for commercial use (fair use with bit of monetization are exempted).
- ... ==FAIR-USE==
- ... ==DIRECTION
- ... ==AI-ASSIST
- ... ==INTEGRITY==
- ... ==ILLUSTRATION==
- ... ==MISCELLANEOUS==
	- **nin827** is the owner of the project, including rights to publish in book/novel/novel medium.
		- See the parent note labeled under OWNERSHIP category.
	- Never, be litigious and sue-happy, like **Nintendo** (the law and patent firm).
	- Never, insult and vilify the target audience, like the **mainstream 2010-2020s Western creative industry**.
	- Always, be neutral in various aspect and avoid sensitive natures as necessary.
		- It is not in my interest to be in "red" or "blue" political teams of any kind, commonly the US bipartisan politics.
			- Besides, this project is not related to 
		- It is not in my interest to be an advocate for or against any politics, social, economic, religion, sexuality, human rights, whatever.
			- Obviously, all people should be free to whatever they please, but this project is not the right platform do be an advocate such thing.
			- Maybe except technology which is for the future, the literal bread and butter of the projectto advance technology, to improve civilization, to set manageable expectations, and to understand associated risks.
		- It is not my interest to platform and preach others, definitely not do conduct like those "activists" (sane activists are fine), there is a proper place and time for that.
	- Never, do retcons, especially for major foundation and pivotal moments.
		- However, retcons are allowed for correcting minor details.
	- Always prioritize long-term trust and goodwill, than short-term profit and exploitation.
		- Profit will always follow if things are done right, as long there is some monetization in place.
