- My writing style is described to be… neutral with a touch of academic or informative writing style, sometimes specific and descriptive.
	- Therefore, expect the writing to be stiff and lengthy at times.
	- Attempts will be made to break sentence and paragraphs into digestible chunks.
- My punctuation style involves many—like the Em Dash–En Dash, plus the well-known hyphens… with ellipses instead of three periods; semicolon are also a great addition for the punctuation toolset.
	- In summary, I primarily use the following in addition to standard punctuations: `;` semicolon, `–` en dash, `—` em dash, `…` ellipses, `&` ampersand.
	- Standard punctuation includes but not limited to: `.` period, `?` question mark, `,` comma, `:` colon, `-` hyphen, `'` single quotation mark, `"` double quotation mark, `(` `)` parentheses,
	- The ellipses and three periods are interchangeable at times, but attempts will be made to standardize into ellipses.
- All punctuation assumes standard usage unless stated below:
	- To indicate separation between descriptions/concepts, like comma but with stronger emphasis — ==… thing — is some object used by …== — em dash with surrounding spaces are used.
		- If stronger separation is needed, the em dash is used like parenthesis — ==… thing — is some object — used by …== .
		- Note that this is distinct from regular em dash usage (without surrounding space), where it is used as pause mid-clause to split element or dialogue.
		- *Most newspapers — and all that follow AP style — insert a space before and after the em dash.
	- To indicate omitted content in a writing — ==… take one each per person … later discard for safety …== — ellipses (with no padding spaces) will be used as placeholder for omission.
		- Normally, omitted writing ellipses are only used in the middle or the end. This writing style will include beginning omission for additional context.
		- Quotes, excerpt, citation, or any word with "selection" meaning does not need to use a beginning ellipses.
