# Demographics

## Age

> Age // ອາຍຸ

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_age.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_age.png)

- Not surprising, since the Facebook and Discord group is targeted towards the young — who are more inclined to creative media and internet culture.

## Gender

> Gender // ເພດ

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_gender.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_gender.png)

- Bit surprising, honestly. Creative media is supposed to be for all due to no restrictions — yet female are more dominant than male in this regard.

## Medium

> Which medium do you enjoy the most? // ເຈົ້າມັກປະເພດສື່ໃດຫຼາຍທີ່ສຸດ? ...

### Novel

> ... Novel // ນິຍາຍ

**Average rated: 3.44/5.00**; the higher, the more they prefer novels.

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_medium_novel.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_medium_novel.png)

### Comic

> ... Comic // ຄອມມິກ

**Average rated: 3.96/5.00**; the higher, the more they prefer comics.

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_comic.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_comic.png)

### Animation + Movie

> ... Animation + Movie // ອານິເມຊັ້ນ + ໜັງ

**Average rated: 4.30/5.00**; the higher, the more they prefer animation and/or movies.

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_medium_animation.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_medium_animation.png)

## Pop Culture

> Are you into pop culture? // ເຈົ້າເຂົ້າໃນດ້ານ pop culture ບໍ່?

**Average rated: 4.02/5.00**; the higher, the more the enjoy pop (and internet) culture.

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_into_pop_culture.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_into_pop_culture.png)

## Story Duration

> Do you like long or short stories? // ເຈົ້າມັກເລື່ອງສັ້ນຫຼືຍາວ?

**Average rated: 3.65/5.00**; the higher, the more they enjoy longer stories.

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_story_duration.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_story_duration.png)

- About half prefers medium length, and the other half prefers longer length.
- This seems to fit fair with the project scope to write long mainline novels, with occasional sideline novels.

## Read-more-online Interest

> If something interests you, would you go read more online? // ຫາກວ່າເຈົ້າສົນໃຈສີ່ງໃດໜື່ງ, ເຈົ້າຈະໄປຄົ້ນອ່ານອອນໄລນ໌ເພີ້ມບໍ່?

**Average rated: 4.61/5.00**; the higher, the more they like reading online.

# Theme & Genre Preferences

> Are you interested to these theme & genre? // ເຈົ້າສົນໃຈກັບປະເພດເລື່ອງນີ້ບໍ່?

**Average score ranges from -100% to 100%**; "Not interested" counts as -1, "neutral" counts as 0, and "Interested" counts as 1.

- Considering that Eastern style is one of dominant themes within East Asia creative media and is widespread within SEA, it's no surprise that it is one of the leading theme.

## Correlation

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_correlation_english.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_correlation_english.png)

### Correlation 101

- Correlation = how much X and Y happens together
- Correlation ≠ causation
	- X goes with Y **does not mean** X causes Y
- **50% ↔ 90%** = X preferred, Y likely **preferred**
- **10% ↔ 50%** = X preferred, Y usually **preferred**
- **-10% ↔ 10%** = X preferred, Y preference or not preferred **is about 50/50**
- **-50% ↔ -10%** = X preferred, Y usually **not preferred**
- **-90% ↔ -50%** = X preferred, Y likely **not preferred**
- **-100% ↔ -90% & 90% ↔ 100%** = Pretty much always measurement error or bad design
	- Measurement error (measurement unit): `height in meters` ↔ `height in centimeters`
	- Measurement error (same data): `Prefers red` ↔ `Prefers red`
	- Bad design (too obvious): `Incidents of flamethrowing homes` ↔ `Incidents of house fires`
	- Bad design (addition of products): `Total calories consumed` ↔ `Total carbohydrate consumed`
	- Bad design (subtraction of total): `Fuel left %` ↔ `Fuel spent %`
	- Bad design (opposite data): `Likes yellow` ↔ `Dislikes yellow`

> To interpret, use this as a question: ==if X interests them, will Y interest them too?==
> - It can also go the opposite: ==if X does not interests them, will Y not interest them too?==

### Notable Observations

- Considering that the main identity theme of the [[SPECIAL/SP_NS22\|Project NS22]] are mecha and technology (plus near future, business, and soft sci-fi):
	- Has strong correlation with action at 51%; mecha (and technology) are often associated with action due to robot fights — although it's a surefire signal, I also would like to explore social aspect with AGI as well.
	- Has strong correlation with sci-fi at 48%; my planned settings will incorporate technological and scientific developments, so a sure yes.
	- Has strong correlation with futuristic at 48%; my planned settings will be near-future so it's a definite combo.
	- Has strong correlation with anthropomorphic at 40%; humanoid robots definitely fit into this equation.
	- Has strong correlation with adventure at 45%; but I do not plan to incorporate much of this.
	- Has significant anti-correlation with eastern theme at -26%; fair point since it usually involves ancient and traditional themes/aesthetics as their settings, not modern not futuristic.
- Unusual observations noticed thus far:
	- Medieval ↔ Magic — They are supposed to go hand-in-hand as they are often used in European-style fantasy, but somehow doesn't combo here?
	- Business ↔ Drama — Surprising it isn't higher due to competition and strategy as core theme — usually it involves emotional conflicts, meticulous strategies, or ruthless backstabbing.
	- Sports ↔ Action — Sports is literally about action and competition, yet there's only weak link between the two???
	- Medieval ↔ Western — Medieval is literally set in old ages of European, of which belongs to the Western, and yet no correlation between both?
	- Not all will be written here, see the correlation chart for yourself and make your own interpretations.

# Project Concepts

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_preference_mechtech_english.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_preference_mechtech_english.png)

- **CONCEPTS** (rank)
	- Side novels (overall 3rd)
	- Near future settings (overall 4th)
	- Soft sci-fi (overall 2nd)
	- Focus on characters' daily life (overall 1st)
	- Robots as human equal (overall 6th)
	- Nuances of AIs (overall 7th)
	- Future speculation (overall 5th)

- Considering the main identity theme of the project is mecha and technology, it will be selected to compare against other various preferences as benchmark.
	- Ignore the `preference_mechtech` row, it is there only as reference and provides no meaningful result here.
		- From now on, `preference_mechtech` will be abbreviated as M&T
	- Other/LGBT gender result is exempted due to low count, results may not be meaningful or reliable with insufficient data.
- **PREFERENCES**
	- As said before, ignore the `preference_mechtech` row.
	- Remember that M&T in [[RESOURCE/NOTE/NO0012#Theme & Genre Preferences\|Theme & Genre Preferences]] at 18th of 20th with score just at a modest 16% (female 13%, male 8%) — only to be favored by small selects, and is the lowest of all preferences listed here.
	- Among those who are **interested** to M&T: females are interested to all presented preferences, while male are only interested to some (slice of life, sci-fi, futuristic, action).
	- Among those who are **neutral** to M&T: female likes other genre/themes more, while males only enjoy few related ones (sci-fi, slice of life, action, crime & detective)
	- Among those who are **not interested** to M&T: there are shared dislikes of action across both gender and significant likes in slice of life, results of all else does not seem noteworthy.
- **ELEMENTS**
	- **0% here does not mean unimportant** — it only means neutral, negative values actually means rated as unimportant.
	- Story is rated virtually an absolute-must among all respondents.
	- Art is rated more important among females who are interested to M&T, where as for male is rated more important among those who are not interested to M&T.
	- Character is rated equally high among all respondents.
	- Worldbuilding is rated as moderately important among all who are interested to M&T, although male has slightly higher score than female in general, and females who are not interested to M&T are completely neutral to worldbuilding.
	- Plot complexity is rated as moderately important among all who are interested to M&T, although males who enjoys M&T rated plot rated it not as important as others.
	- Originality is rated as moderately important among all who are interested to M&T, although males who are not interested in M&T as much as others has lower score.
	- Appeal (cool & cute) is rated as significantly higher in female than male, female has more score the more they are not interested to M&T, while male has large spike in appeal among those who are neutral, and male who are interested or are not interested is completely indifferent to appeal.
		- Technically, this should also include "beauty" but the wording is missing — hope this does not affect the results too much.
