- *Comprehensive statistical analysis and data visualization involving Laos (and some international) users regarding creative media preferences, consumption habits, and opinions of project ideas. The survey is conducted on July 2025.*
- This survey is primarily conducted on [Laos Artist Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/laosartists/) on [Facebook](https://facebook.com), alongside with various smaller online community and groups.
	- The survey is conducted from 10/07/2025 until 20/07/2025 18:00 (UTC+7).
- The main identity theme of [[SPECIAL/SP_NB22\|Project NB22]] is mecha & technology (as well as soft sci-fi, near future, and bits of sci-fi), particularly "robots as human equal" concept — yet it is rated moderately on average, yet very polarized between those who prefer and not prefer towards it.
	- There may be plenty "robots as human equal" concepts (or similar ones) out there, but the project aims to use one that has clear robotic appearance and is sapient & sentient — while avoiding tropes portraying them as pseudo-superhumans.
	- Most other "robots as human equal" often involve perfect human-like appearance (minus few features) appearance to blend with people, this project aims to present them as outwardly with no perfect human-like appearance — also avoiding uncanny valley effect altogether.
- Key takeaway is the [[SPECIAL/SP_NB22\|Project NB22]] is going to target and satisfy a specific niche, considering that the key-defining "robots as human equal" is not rated so high in general, but rated quite moderate among those who are inclined towards mecha & technology.
	- Other associated concepts, themes, and genre are rated fairly well, but still falls off compared to other aspects.
	- Careful planning and smooth execution will be crucial for the project to be successful, considering there virtually no other media that has similar ideas; there may be similar ideas, but it is not specific enough.
- The survey results and covered aspects may not be fully comprehensive nor is highly reliable — mostly due to limited responses collected from small online community, and reduced amount of questions to facilitate with faster response time.

# Demographics

## Age

> Age // ອາຍຸ

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_age.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_age.png)

- Not surprising, since the Facebook and Discord group is targeted towards the young — who are more inclined to creative media and internet culture.

## Gender

> Gender // ເພດ

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_gender.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_gender.png)

- Bit surprising, honestly. Creative media is supposed to be for all due to no restrictions — yet female are more dominant than male in this regard.

## Medium

> Which medium do you enjoy the most? // ເຈົ້າມັກປະເພດສື່ໃດຫຼາຍທີ່ສຸດ? ...

### Novel

> ... Novel // ນິຍາຍ

**Average rated: 3.44/5.00**; the higher, the more they prefer novels.

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_medium_novel.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_medium_novel.png)

### Comic

> ... Comic // ຄອມມິກ

**Average rated: 3.96/5.00**; the higher, the more they prefer comics.

### Animation + Movie

> ... Animation + Movie // ອານິເມຊັ້ນ + ໜັງ

**Average rated: 4.30/5.00**; the higher, the more they prefer animation and/or movies.

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_medium_animation.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_medium_animation.png)

## Pop Culture

> Are you into pop culture? // ເຈົ້າເຂົ້າໃນດ້ານ pop culture ບໍ່?

**Average rated: 4.02/5.00**; the higher, the more the enjoy pop (and internet) culture.

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_into_pop_culture.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_into_pop_culture.png)

## Story Duration

> Do you like long or short stories? // ເຈົ້າມັກເລື່ອງສັ້ນຫຼືຍາວ?

**Average rated: 3.65/5.00**; the higher, the more they enjoy longer stories.

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_story_duration.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_story_duration.png)

- About half prefers medium length, and the other half prefers longer length.
- This seems to fit fair with the project scope to write long mainline novels, with occasional sideline novels.

## Read-more-online Interest

> If something interests you, would you go read more online? // ຫາກວ່າເຈົ້າສົນໃຈສີ່ງໃດໜື່ງ, ເຈົ້າຈະໄປຄົ້ນອ່ານອອນໄລນ໌ເພີ້ມບໍ່?

**Average rated: 4.61/5.00**; the higher, the more they like reading online.

| 14   | Drama                          | 5              | 22      | 22         | 35%           |

| 18   | Mecha & Technology             | 10             | 21      | 18         | 16%           |
| 19   | Anthropomorphic                | 16             | 26      | 7          | -18%          |
| 20   | Sports                         | 21             | 19      | 9          | -24%          |

**Average score ranges from -100% to 100%**; "Not interested" = -1, "Neutral" = 0, and "Interested" = 1.

- Considering that Eastern style is one of dominant themes within East Asia creative media and is widespread within SEA, it's no surprise that it is one of the leading theme.
- Fantasy theme is not included in the survey due to limited question space, but it is probable it will be in top 5 due to strong correlation with popular themes such as magic, medieval, isekai/otherworld, etc.
- Future-related themes such as sci-fi, futuristic, and mecha & technology itself are generally rated lower to classic-related themes (fantasy, magic, etc).
- Mecha & technology seems to be the most polarized in terms of preference, having the highest interested and not interested combined, and highest mid-point between the two.

## Correlation

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_correlation_english.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_correlation_english.png)

### Correlation 101

- Correlation = how much X and Y happens together
- Correlation ≠ causation
	- X goes with Y **does not mean** X causes Y
- **50% ↔ 90%** = X preferred, Y likely **preferred**
- **10% ↔ 50%** = X preferred, Y usually **preferred**
- **-10% ↔ 10%** = X preferred, Y preference or not preferred **is about 50/50**
- **-50% ↔ -10%** = X preferred, Y usually **not preferred**
- **-90% ↔ -50%** = X preferred, Y likely **not preferred**
- **-100% ↔ -90% & 90% ↔ 100%** = Pretty much always measurement error or bad design
	- Measurement error (measurement unit): `height in meters` ↔ `height in centimeters`
	- Measurement error (same data): `Prefers red` ↔ `Prefers red`
	- Bad design (too obvious): `Incidents of flamethrowing homes` ↔ `Incidents of house fires`
	- Bad design (addition of products): `Total calories consumed` ↔ `Total carbohydrate consumed`
	- Bad design (subtraction of total): `Fuel left %` ↔ `Fuel spent %`
	- Bad design (opposite data): `Likes yellow` ↔ `Dislikes yellow`

> To interpret, use this as a question: ==if X interests them, will Y interest them too?==
> - It can also go the opposite: ==if X does not interests them, will Y not interest them too?==

### Notable Observations

- Considering that the main identity theme of the [[SPECIAL/SP_NB22\|Project NB22]] are mecha and technology (plus near future, business, and soft sci-fi):
	- Has strong correlation with action at 51%; mecha (and technology) are often associated with action due to robot fights — although it's a surefire signal, I also would like to explore social aspect with AGI as well.
	- Has strong correlation with sci-fi at 48%; my planned settings will incorporate technological and scientific developments, so a sure yes.
	- Has strong correlation with futuristic at 48%; my planned settings will be near-future so it's a definite combo.
	- Has strong correlation with anthropomorphic at 40%; humanoid robots definitely fit into this equation.
	- Has strong correlation with adventure at 45%; but I do not plan to incorporate much of this.
	- Has significant anti-correlation with eastern theme at -26%; fair point since it usually involves ancient and traditional themes/aesthetics as their settings, not modern not futuristic.
- Unusual observations noticed thus far:
	- Medieval ↔ Magic — They are supposed to go hand-in-hand as they are often used in European-style fantasy, but somehow doesn't combo here?
	- Business ↔ Drama — Surprising it isn't higher due to competition and strategy as core theme — usually it involves emotional conflicts, meticulous strategies, or ruthless backstabbing.
	- Sports ↔ Action — Sports is literally about action and competition, yet there's only weak link between the two???
	- Medieval ↔ Western — Medieval is literally set in old ages of European, of which belongs to the Western, and yet no correlation between both?
	- Not all will be written here, see the correlation chart for yourself and make your own interpretations.

# Project Concepts

![CHART_LaoSurvey2507_preference_mechtech_english.png|sample4](/img/user/RESOURCE/ASSET/OTHER/CHART_LaoSurvey2507_preference_mechtech_english.png)

- Considering the main identity theme of the project is mecha and technology, it will be selected to compare against other various preferences as benchmark.
	- From now on, `preference_mechtech` will be abbreviated as M&T
	- Ignore the `preference_mechtech` row, it is there only as reference and provides no meaningful result here.
	- Other/LGBT gender result is exempted due to low count, results may not be meaningful or reliable with insufficient data.
	- Note to take this reading with a **grain of salt** (skepticism) due to low data count, as results are split by gender and preference in M&T — results here are not as reliable nor confident as correlation reading above.
- Category: **MEDIUM** and others
	- There is a correlation in preferences toward shorter story length (still sits at medium) among those who prefers M&T, and the average of female is higher than those of male — except for male who prefers M&T, there is a slight rebound/increase in preferred story length.
	- There is a correlation in lower preference score in novels to higher interest to M&T, female has higher average and weaker correlation, whereas male has lower average and strong correlation.
		-  Maybe results could be more determinate if there is a separation between "pure-text" novels and "contains some illustration" novels.
	- Across all medium, female has higher average preference score than male for some reason.
	- Results and reading of all else in these category are not so noteworthy nor is significant enough.
- Category: **PREFERENCES**
	- As said before, ignore the `preference_mechtech` row.
	- Remember that M&T in [[RESOURCE/NOTE/NO0012#Theme & Genre Preferences\|Theme & Genre Preferences]] at 18th of 20th with score just at a modest 16% (female 13%, male 8%) — only to be favored by small selects, and is the lowest of all preferences listed here.
	- Among those who are **interested** to M&T: females are interested to all presented preferences, while male are only interested to some (slice of life, sci-fi, futuristic, action).
	- Among those who are **neutral** to M&T: female likes other genre/themes more, while males only enjoy few related ones (sci-fi, slice of life, action, crime & detective)
	- Among those who are **not interested** to M&T: there are shared dislikes of action across both gender and significant likes in slice of life, results of all else does not seem noteworthy.
- Category: **ELEMENTS**
	- **0% here does not mean unimportant** — it only means neutral, negative values actually means rated as unimportant.
	- Story is rated virtually an absolute-must among all respondents.
	- Art is rated more important among females who are interested to M&T, where as for male is rated more important among those who are not interested to M&T.
	- Character is rated equally high among all respondents.
	- Worldbuilding is rated as moderately important among all who are interested to M&T, although male has slightly higher score than female in general, and females who are not interested to M&T are completely neutral to worldbuilding.
	- Plot complexity is rated as moderately important among all who are interested to M&T, although males who enjoys M&T rated plot rated it not as important as others.
	- Originality is rated as moderately important among all who are interested to M&T, although males who are not interested in M&T as much as others has lower score.
	- Appeal (cool & cute) is rated as significantly higher in female than male, female has more score the more they are not interested to M&T, while male has large spike in appeal among those who are neutral, and male who are interested or are not interested is completely indifferent to appeal.
		- Technically, this should also include "beauty" but the wording is missing — hope this does not affect the results too much.
- Category: **CONCEPTS** (rank)
	- Focus on characters' daily life (overall 1st) rated as highest of all, higher rank correlates with them not interested to M&T.
	- Soft sci-fi (overall 2nd) has some correlation with interest to M&T among females, whereas male has no notable correlation but has about equal average ranking.
	- Side novels (overall 3rd) has anti-correlation with females who are interested to M&T, while there are correlation with male who are interested to M&T.
	- Near future settings (overall 4th) has correlation to those who are interested to M&T, correlation is lot more clear and consistent in male than female.
	- Future speculation (overall 5th) has lower rank among those who are interested to M&T for some reason, even though it is literally about future and sci-fi (which plays with the future).
	- Robots as human equal (overall 6th) has significantly higher rank among male than female, and there is some correlation between interest to M&T and average ranking of this concept.
	- Nuances of AIs (overall 7th) rated the lowest of all, those who are not interested in M&T rates higher rank than those who are interested, differences get more significant (and even lower rank) the more they like M&T.
