- *Characters' legal name must follow according to their national/cultural ordering format. Use Mr. or Ms. (ignoring Mrs.), first name uses Title Case, middle name uses "Title Case" in quotes, last name uses UPPER CASE, and follow their local name ordering.*
- Example of full names in proper format are as follows:
	- Ms. Anna KOWALSKA — standard name.
	- Mr. John "Chris" DOE — standard name with middle name.
	- Ms. NANASHI Gonbei — last name comes before first name.
	- Mr. Juan Dela CRUZ — first name comes in multiple words.
	- Mr. Thurein Bo Thura Phone — name without last name.
