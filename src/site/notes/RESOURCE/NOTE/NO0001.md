	- **nin827** is the owner of the project, including rights to publish in book/novel/novel medium.
	- Never, be litigious and sue-happy, like **Nintendo** (the law and patent firm).
	- Never, insult and vilify the target audience, like the **mainstream 2010-2020s Western creative industry**.
	- Always, be neutral in various aspect and avoid sensitive natures as necessary.
		- It is not in my interest to be in "red" or "blue" political teams of any kind, commonly the US bipartisan politics.
			- Besides, this project is not related to 
		- It is not in my interest to be an advocate for or against any politics, social, economic, religion, sexuality, human rights, whatever.
			- Obviously, all people should be free to whatever they please, but this project is not the right platform do be an advocate such thing.
			- Maybe except technology which is for the future, the literal bread and butter of the projectto advance technology, to improve civilization, to set manageable expectations, and to understand associated risks.
		- It is not my interest to platform and preach others, definitely not do conduct like those "activists" (sane activists are fine), there is a proper place and time for that.
	- Never, do retcons, especially for major foundation and pivotal moments.
		- However, retcons are allowed for correcting minor details.
	- Always prioritize long-term trust and goodwill, than short-term profit and exploitation.
		- Profit will always follow if things are done right, as long there is some monetization in place.
