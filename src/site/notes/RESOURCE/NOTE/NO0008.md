1. Main production approach and philosophy are [1] never recon established settings if done distastefully, [2] remain neutral and civil in any controversial topics, and [3] approach any subjects in a logical and constructive manner; refer more to the endnote or [[RESOURCE/NOTE/NO0010\|Integrity, Consistency, Trust]]. [^1]
2. Writing is expected to be formatted and structured as A6 light novel, with occasional quick-sketch thumbnail illustrations to complement the writing, essentially a hybrid of (Japanese style if you prefer) novel and comic.
3. These literary and illustrative works will be published on personal [GitHub Pages](https://nin827.github.jo) and also saved as Markdown `.md` file for future proofing.
4. Chapters should include 6 sections in total, each including a standard thumbnail, content spanning 2 pages at all times, and paragraphs spanning 3–6 lines on average (up to 12 maximums on rare cases).
5. Every setting (event and character) must at least have a section-length snippet containing 3 scenarios (focus, main, and extra) under standard circumstances. In addition to main snippet content, each snippet should also have brief-single-sentence as a descriptor.
6. All snippets will have 1 sentence version as a brief descriptor. The scenario will have normal-length snippet to flesh out the setting, however, the main scenario illustration will be used to represent that said setting.
7. **Narrative notes**:
	1. The main timeline is expected to be based on modern and contemporary Bangkok (in Thailand) focusing on observation and events of the real life. However, there are added concepts being sentient–AI androids, technological advancement, and various unusual phenomenon. Refer more to [[RESOURCE/NOTE/NO0001\|nin827's Project NS22 Remarks]]
	2. As the story and setting will be partially based on modern real-life but with additional fictional science stuff added and is meant to mimic real life, the theme can be categorized to be contemporary and speculative sci-fi as for the theme.
	3. The story will employ omniscient third-person perspective for the most part, though there may be some parts that uses first-person perspective, but this will have to be explicitly stated one way or another to avoid confusion.
	4. Should there ever be a case of having different timelines, the main one will be the Modern Timeline; subjected to future changes, if there will be any. Refer more to [[MATERIAL/ARTICLE/AR007\|NS22 Event & Timeline]]

[^1]: Novel print format size will be A6 at 4.13 by 5.83 inches, with margin of 0.5 by 0.5 inches, with vertical orientation, with illustration image size of at 1.2 by 1.2 inches per 512 by 512 pixels (as with image canvas size), with image resolution of 250 pixels per inch; other specifications are non-illustration images size of 0.3 inches increments (ideally in square aspect ratio).
